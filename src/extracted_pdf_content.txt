Keywords: From unique educational perspectives, this article reports a comprehensive review of selected empirical studies

were fully reviewed using multiple methods, including selected bibliometrics, content analysis and categorical
meta-trends analysis. This article reports the current state of AIEd research, highlights selected AIEd technologies
and applications, reviews their proven and potential benefits for education, bridges the gaps between AI tech-
nological innovations and their educational applications, and generates practical examples and inspirations for
both technological experts that create AIEd technologies and educators who spearhead AI innovations in edu-
cation. It also provides rich discussions on practical implications and future research directions from multiple
perspectives. The advancement of AIEd calls for critical initiatives to address AI ethics and privacy concerns, and
requires interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaborations in large-scaled, longitudinal research and devel-
opment efforts.

Machine Learning Algorithms - A Review
Batta Mahesh
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a
specific task without being explicitly programmed. Learning algorithms in many applications that’s we make use of daily. Every time a
web search engine like Google is used to search the internet, one of the reasons that work so well is because a learning algorithm that
has learned how to rank web pages. These algorithms are used for various purposes like data mining, image processing, predictive
analytics, etc. to name a few. The main advantage of using machine learning is that, once an algorithm learns what to do with data, it
can do its work automatically. In this paper, a brief review and future prospect of the vast applications of machine learning algorithms
has been made.
Keywords: Algorithm, Machine Learning, Pseudo Code, Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Reinforcement learning

Here‟s a quick look at some of the commonly used
algorithms in machine learning (ML)
Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning
a function that maps an input to an output based on example
input-output pairs. It infers a function from labelled training
data consisting of a set of training examples. The supervised
machine learning algorithms are those algorithms which Figure: Supervised learning Workflow

Decision Tree
Decision tree is a graph to represent choices and their results
in form of a tree. The nodes in the graph represent an event
or choice and the edges of the graph represent the decision
rules or conditions. Each tree consists of nodes and
branches. Each node represents attributes in a group that is
to be classified and each branch represents a value that the
node can take.

Navie Bayes
It is a classification technique based on Bayes Theorem with
an assumption of independence among predictors. In simple
terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of
a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of
any other feature. Naïve Bayes mainly targets the text
classification industry. It is mainly used for clustering and
classification purpose depends on the conditional probability

Self-Training
In self-training, a classifier is trained with a portion of

specially designed for real time processing in contrasts with
hadoop which is for batch processing. Additionally, it is also
easy to set up and operate, scalable, fault-tolerant to provide

similar to hadoop cluster. On storm cluster users run different
topologies for different storm tasks whereas hadoop platform
implements map reduce jobs for corresponding applications.

1 Introduction
Recent tremendous technical advances in processing power, storage capacity, and inter-connectivity of com-
puter technologyis creatingunprecedentedquantitiesofdigitaldata. Data mining,the scienceofextracting
useful knowledge from such huge data repositories, has emerged as a young and interdisciplinary field in
computer science. Data mining techniques have been widely applied to problems in industry, science, en-
gineering and government, and it is widely believed that data mining will have profound impact on our
society. The growing consensus that data mining can bring real value has led to an explosion in demand
for novel data mining technologies and for students who are trained in data mining—students who have an
understanding of data mining techniques, can apply them to real-life problems, and are trained for research
and development of new data mining methods. Courses in data mining have started to sprawl all over the
world.
Based on this development of the field, the ACM SIGKDD Executive Committee has set up the ACM
SIGKDDCurriculumCommitteetodesignasamplecurriculumfordataminingthatgivesrecommendations
foreducatingthenextgenerationofstudentsindatamining. Basedonfeedbackfromresearchers,educators,
andstudents,weareconvincedthatitisanimportanttasktohaveacarefullydesigned,conceptuallystrong,
technically rich, and balancedcurriculum for this discipline. A comprehensiveand balanced curriculum will
ensurethattheeducationindataminingsetsasolidfoundationforthehealthygrowthofthefield,anditwill
promote systematic training of students in computer science, information sciences, and other related fields,
and it will provide guidance for the training of the next generation of data mining researchers, developers
and technology users.
The Curriculum Committee is composed of university professors and researcherswho have actively con-
tributed to data mining research and education, researchers and practitioners from industry who have rich
experiences in applying data mining technology, and administrators from government agencies. This report
is the first draft from the Intensive Working Group of the Committee. We expect that this draft will be
extensively revised and reviewed, and we are looking forwardto suggestions and recommendations from the
Committee and from the general data mining research,development, and application community.
The remainder of this report is structured as follows. First, we outline the principles that guided us in
the selection of material in Section 2. We then give a brief description of the prerequisites that we assume
students of our proposed curriculum to have in Section 3. Section 4 contains the core of this document, our
curriculum proposal.
2 Curriculum Design Philosophy
Data mining is aninterdisciplinaryfieldatthe intersectionofartificialintelligence,machine learning,statis-
tics, and database systems, and we believe that different educators will emphasize different topics in their
1courses. Thuswedividedthis curriculumproposalintotwoparts. ThefirstparttitledFoundations contains
basic material that we believe should be covered in any introductory course on data mining. The second
part called Advanced Topics is a comprehensive collection of material that can be sampled to complete an
introductory course or selections of which can form the basis for an advanced course in data mining.
We believe that the teaching of data mining should concentrate on long-lasting scientific principles and
concepts of the field. Thus instead of covering the last details of the most recent research, we designed the
basic material to lay a solid foundation that opens the door to explore more advanced material.
The core endeavor in data mining is to extract knowledge from data; this knowledge is captured in a
human-understandablestructure. The discoveryofstructure in data is a multifaceted problemthat includes
the following components:
Database and Data Management Issues: Wheredoesthedatareside? Howisittobeaccessed? What
forms of sampling are needed? are possible? are appropriate? What are the implications of the
database or data warehouse structure and constraints on data movement and data preparation?
Data Preprocessing: What are the required data transformations before a chosen algorithm or class of
algorithms can be applied to the data? What are effective methods for reducing the dimensionality of
of the data so the algorithmscan work efficiently? How are missing data items to be modelled? What
transformations properly encode a priori knowledge of the problem?
Choice of Model and Statistical Inference Considerations: What are the appropriatechoices to en-
sure proper statistical inference? What are valid approximations? What are the implications of the
inferencemethodsontheexpectedresults? Howis theresultingstructuretobe evaluated? Validated?
Interestingness Metrics: What makes the derived structure interesting or useful? How do the goals of
the particular data mining activity influence the choice of algorithms or techniques to be used?
Algorithmic Complexity Considerations: What choice of algorithmsbased onthe size anddimension-
alityofdata? Whataboutcomputationalresourceconstraints? Requirementsonaccuracyofresulting
models? What are the scalability considerations and how should they be addressed?
Post-processing of Discovered Structure: How are the results to be used? What are the requirements
foruseatpredictiontime? Whatarethetransformationrequirementsatmodelapplicationtime? How
are changes in the data or underlying distributions to be managed?
Visualization and Understandability: What are the constraints on the discovered structure from the
perspectiveofunderstandabilitybyhumans? Whatareeffectivevisualizationtechniquesfortheresult-
ingstructure? Howcandatabeeffectivelyvisualizedinthecontextoforwiththeaidofthediscovered
structures?
Maintenance, Updates, and Model Life Cycle Considerations: When are models to be changed or
updated? How must the models change as the utility metrics in the application domain change? How
are the resulting predictions or discovered structure integrated with application domain metrics and
constraints?
The partial list above demonstrates that data mining involves many problems and many notions that
have historically been studies in isolation. This necessitates a healthy coverage of a wide range of areas
within the proposed curriculum.
3 Prerequisites
Dataminingisabroadfieldthatcombinestechniquesfromdifferentareasincomputerscienceandstatistics.
Our model curriculum assumes that students have basic background knowledge in the following areas:
2Database Systems: Data models, query languages, SQL, conceptual database design, query processing,
and transaction processing.
Statistics: Expectation,basicprobability,distributions,hypothesistests,ANOVA,andestimatingadistri-
bution parameter.
Linear Algebra: Vectorsandmatrices,vectorspaces,basis,matrixinversion,andsolvinglinearequations.
Algorithms and Data Structures: We assume familiarity with basic data structures and general matu-
rity of students to understand algorithms written in pseudo-code.
We believe that most computer science seniors either have covered this material in previous courses, can
pick up missing materialin self-study, or that the missing materialis introduced by the courseinstructor as
necessary.

1. Executive Summary
A group of researchers met in Chicago in July, 1997 and in La Jolla in March, 1997 and February, 1998
to discuss the current state of the art of data mining and data intensive computing and the opportunities
and challenges for the future. The focus of the discussions was on mining large, massive, and distributed
data sets. Here are the main conclusions of the workshops:
The field of data mining and knowledge discovery is emerging as a new, fundamental research
area with important applications to science, engineering, medicine, business, and education. Data
mining attempts to formulate, analyze and implement basic induction processes that facilitate the
extraction of meaningful information and knowledge from unstructured data. Data mining extracts
patterns, changes, associations and anomalies from large data sets. Work in data mining ranges
from theoretical work on the principles of learning and mathematical representations of data to
building advanced engineering systems that perform information filtering on the web, find genes
in DNA sequences, help understand trends and anomalies in economics and education, and detect
network intrusion. Data mining is also a promising computational paradigm that enhances
traditional approaches to discovery and increases the opportunities for breakthroughs in the
understanding of complex physical and biological systems. Researchers from many intellectual
communities have much to contribute to this field. These include the communities of machine
learning, statistics, databases, visualization and graphics, optimization, computational
mathematics, and the theory of algorithms.
The amount of digital data has been exploding during the past decade, while the number of
scientists, engineers, and analysts available to analyze the data has been static. To bridge this gap
requires the solution of fundamentally new research problems, which can be grouped into the
following broad challenges: A) developing algorithms and systems to mine large, massive and
high dimensional data sets; B) developing algorithms and systems to mine new types of data; C)
developing algorithms, protocols, and other infrastructure to mine distributed data; and D)
improving the ease of use of data mining systems; E) developing appropriate privacy and securitymodels for data mining.
There is an important need for support by government and business of basic, applied,
multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research in data mining and knowledge discovery in order
to respond to these challenges.
There is an important experimental component to data mining and knowledge discovery which
requires the creation and maintenance of appropriate systems, computational infrastructures and
test beds.
2. What is Data Mining?
Data mining is the semi-automatic discovery of patterns, associations, changes, anomalies, rules, and
statistically significant structures and events in data. That is, data mining attempts to extract knowledge
from data.
Data mining differs from traditional statistics in several ways: formal statistical inference is assumption
driven in the sense that a hypothesis is formed and validated against the data. Data mining in contrast is
discovery driven in the sense that patterns and hypothesis are automatically extracted from data. Said
another way, data mining is data driven, while statistics is human driven. The branch of statistics that
data mining resembles most is exploratory data analysis, although this field, like most of the rest of
statistics, has been focused on data sets far smaller than most that are the target of data mining
researchers.
Data mining also differs from traditional statistics in that sometimes the goal is to extract qualitative
models which can easily be translated into logical rules or visual representations; in this sense data
mining is human centered and is sometimes coupled with human-computer interfaces research.
Data mining is a step in the data mining process, which is an interactive, semi-automated process which
begins with raw data. Results of the data mining process may be insights, rules, or predictive models.
The field of data mining draws upon several roots, including statistics, machine learning, databases, and
high performance computing.
In this report, we are primarily concerned with large data sets, massive data sets, and distributed data
sets. By large, we mean data sets which are too large to fit into the memory of a single workstation. By
massive, we mean data sets which are too large to fit onto the disks of a single workstation or a small
cluster of workstations. Instead, massive clusters or tertiary storage such as tape are required. By
distributed, we mean data sets which are geographically distributed.
The focus on large data sets is not an just an engineering challenge; it is an essential feature of induction
of expressive representations from raw data. It is only by analyzing large data sets that we can produce
accurate logical descriptions that can be translated automatically into powerful predictive mechanisms.
Otherwise, statistical and machine learning principles suggest the need for substantial user input
(specifying meta-knowledge necessary to acquire highly predictive models from small data sets).
3. Recent Research AchievementsThe opportunities today in data mining rest solidly on a variety of research achievements, the majority
of which were the result of government sponsored research. In this section, we mention a few of the
more important ones. Note that several of them are interdisciplinary in nature, resting on discoveries
made by researchers from different disciplines working together collaboratively.
Neural Networks. Neural networks are systems inspired by the human brain. A basic example is
provided by a back propagation network which consists of input nodes, output nodes, and intermediate
nodes called hidden nodes. Initially, the nodes are connected with random weights. During the training,
a gradient descent algorithm is used to adjust the weights so that the output nodes correctly classify data
presented to the input nodes. The algorithm was invented independently by several groups of
researchers.
Tree-based Classifiers. A tree is a convenient way to break a large data sets into smaller ones. By
presenting a learning set to the root and asking questions at each interior node, the data at the leaves can
often be analyzed very simply. For example, a classifier to predict the likelihood that a credit card
transaction is fraudulent may use an interior node to divide a training data set into two sets, depending
upon whether or not five or fewer transactions were processed during the previous hour. After a series of
such questions, each leaf can be labeled fraud/no-fraud by using a simple majority vote. Tree based
classifiers were independently invented in information theory, statistics, pattern recognition and machine
learning.
Graphical Models and Hierarchical Probabilistic Representations. A directed graph is a good means of
organizing information about qualitative knowledge about conditional independence and causality
gleamed from domain experts. Graphical models generalize generalize Markov models and hidden
Markov models, which have proved themselves to be a powerful modeling tool. Graphical models were
independently invented by computational probabilists and artificial intelligence researchers studying
uncertainty.
Ensemble Learning. Rather than use data mining to build a single predictive model, it is often better to
build a collection or ensemble of models and to combine them, say with a simple, efficient voting
strategy. This simple idea has now been applied in a wide variety of contexts and applications. In some
circumstances, this technique is known to reduce variance of the predictions and therefore to decrease
the overall error of the model.
Linear Algebra. Scaling data mining algorithms often depends critically upon scaling underlying
computations in linear algebra. Recent work in parallel algorithms for solving linear system and
algorithms for solving sparse linear systems in high dimensions are important for a variety of data
mining applications, ranging from text mining to detecting network intrusions.
Large Scale Optimization. Some data mining algorithms can be expressed as large-scale, often
non-convex, optimization problems. Recent work has provided parallel and distributed methods for
large-scale continuous and discrete optimization problems, including heuristic search methods for
problems too large to be solved exactly.
High Performance Computing and Communication. Data mining requires statistically intensive
operations on large data sets. These types of computations would not be practical without the emergence
of powerful SMP workstations and high performance clusters of workstations supporting protocols for
high performance computing such as MPI and MPIO. Distributed data mining can require moving largeamounts of data between geographically separated sites, something which is now possible with the
emergence of wide area high performance networks.
Databases, Data Warehouses, and Digital Libraries. The most time consuming part of the data mining
process is preparing data for data mining. This step can be stream-lined in part if the data is already in a
database, data warehouse, or digital library, although mining data across different databases, for
example, is still a challenge. Some algorithms, such as association algorithms, are closely connected to
databases, while some of the primitive operations being built into tomorrow’s data warehouses should
prove useful for some data mining applications.
Visualization of Massive Data Sets. Massive data sets, often generated by complex simulation programs,
required graphical visualization methods for best comprehension. Recent advances in multi-scale
visualization allow the rendering to be done far more quickly and in parallel, making these visualization
tasks practical.
4. New Applications
The discipline of data mining is driven in part by new applications which require new capabilities not
currently being supplied by today’s technology. These new applications can be naturally divided into
three broad categories.
a. Business & E-commerce Data. Back-office, front-office, and network applications produce large
amounts of data about business processes. Using this data for effective decision making remains a
fundamental challenge.
b. Scientific, Engineering & Health Care Data. Scientific data and meta-data tend to be more
complex in structure than business data. In addition, scientists and engineers are making increasing
use of simulation and of systems with application domain knowledge.
c. Web Data. The data on the web is growing not only in volume but also in complexity. Web data
now includes not only text and image, but also streaming data and numerical data.
In this section, we describe several such applications from each category.
Business Transactions. Today, businesses are consolidating and more and more businesses have millions
of customers and billions of their transactions. They need to understand risks (Is this transaction
fraudulent? Will this customer pay their bills?) and opportunities (What is the expected profit of this
customer? What product is this customer most likely to buy next?).
Electronic Commerce. Not only does electronic commerce produce large data sets in which the analysis
of marketing patterns and risk patterns is critical, but unlike some of the applications above, it is also
important to do this in real or near-real time, in order to meet the demands of on-line transactions.
Genomic Data. Genomic sequencing and mapping efforts have produced a number of databases which
are accessible over the web. In addition, there are also a wide variety of other on-line databases,
including those containing information about diseases, cellular function, and drugs. Finding
relationships between these data sources, which are largely unexplored, is another fundamental data
mining challenge. Recently, scalable techniques have been developed for comparing whole genomes.Sensor Data. Satellites, buoys, balloons, and a variety of other sensors produce voluminous amounts of
data about the earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and lands. A fundamental challenge is to understand the
relationships, including causal relationships amongst this data. For example, do industrial pollutants
affect global warming? There are also large terabyte to petabyte data sets being produced by sensors and
instruments in other disciplines, such as astronomy, high energy physics, and nuclear physics.
Simulation Data. Simulation is now accepted as a third mode of science, supplementing theory and
experiment. Today, not only do experiments produce huge data sets, but so do simulations. Data mining,
and more generally data intensive computing, is proving to be a critical link between theory, simulation,
and experiment.
Health Care Data. Health care has been the most rapidly growing segment of the nation’s GDP for some
time. Hospitals, health care organizations, insurance companies, and the federal government have large
collections of data about patients, their health care problems, the clinical procedures used, their costs,
and the outcomes. Understanding relationships in this data is critical for a wide variety of problems,
ranging from determining what procedures and clinical protocols are most effective to how best to
deliver health care to the most people in an era of diminishing resources.
Multi-media Documents. Few people are satisfied with today’s technology for retrieving documents on
the web, yet the number of documents and the number of people accessing these documents is growing
explosively. In addition, it is becoming easier and and easier to archive multi-media data, including
audio, images, and video data, but harder and harder to extract meaningful information from the archives
as the volume grows.
The Data Web. Today the web is primarily oriented toward documents and their multi-media extensions.
HTML has proved itself to be a simple, yet powerful language for supporting this. Tomorrow the
potential exists for the web to prove equally important for working with data. The Extensible Markup
Language (XML) is an emerging language for working with data in networked environments. As this
infrastructure grows, data mining is expected to be a critical enabling technology for the emerging data
web.
5. Success Stories
In this section, we briefly describe some success stories involving data mining and knowledge
discovery.
Association Rules. Suppose we have a collection of items. The data for many applications consists of
multiple transactions, where each transaction consists of one or more items. A basic example is provided
by a supermarket, where the items are the products offered for sale and the transactions are purchases,
consisting of one or more products purchased by an individual at a given time. A fundamental problem
is to uncover associations: which products tend to be purchased together. There has been a lot of recent
work on this problem and a variety of algorithms have been developed which can be discover
associations, even in very large data sets, with just a few passes over the data. A variety of commercial
data mining systems support association rules and they are now routinely applied to a range of problems
from database marketing to product placement for supermarkets. In addition, association rules
algorithms have spurred new research in a variety of areas from databases to complexity theory.
Fraud Detection. Although relatively few credit card transactions are fraudulent, the sheer volume oftransactions means that over $500M are lost each year in this way. A variety of data mining techniques
have been used to develop fraud systems which can detect fraudulent credit card transactions in
near-real time. This problem is challenging due to the size of the data sets, the rarity of the events of
interest, and the performance requirements for near-real time detection. Data mining has also improved
fraud detection in other application areas, including telcom fraud and insurance fraud.
Astronomical Data. Traditionally, the search for new galaxies, stars, and quasars has primarily been
done by astronomers visually examining individual photographic plates. Classification algorithms from
data mining have recently been used to automate this process yielding new astronomical discoveries.
The classification algorithms are applied to derived attributes produced by image processing, such as the
brightness, area, and morphology of sky objects. The approach has also proved useful for detecting new
objects too faint to be observed by a manual analysis or traditional computational techniques. For the
2nd Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, this approach resulted in over a three-fold increase in the size of
the catalog.
Genomic Data. Genomic data is stored all over the world, in a variety of formats and managed by a
variety of applications and systems. Recently, systems have been developed which allow discoveries to
be made involving information distributed over several systems. In particular, the new systems have
enabled for the first time whole genome comparison, gene identification, and whole genome functional
interpretation and analysis. The techniques developed for analyzing genomic and other types of
scientific data can be expected to to play a role on analyzing a broad range of biological data.
Distributed Data Mining.Traditionally, data mining has required that the relevant data be warehoused in
a single location. Recently, distributed data mining systems have exploited wide area, high performance
next networks, such as the NSF vBNS network, to mine large amounts of distributed scientific and
health care data. Recently, these systems have set records for the sustained movement of very large
amounts of data over wide area networks. Separately, a prototype has been developed exploiting
distributed data mining to improve the detection of credit card fraud.
Text Mining. Recently, data mining has been combined with algorithms from information retrieval to
improve the precision and recall of queries on very large collections of documents. In particular, some
of these algorithms have proved useful on multi-lingual collections and others have shown their worth
on querying using concepts instead of key words.
6. Trends that Effect Data Mining
In this section, we describe five external trends which promise to have a fundamental impact on data
mining.
Data Trends. Perhaps the most fundamental external trend is the explosion of digital data during the past
two decades. During this period, the amount of data probably has grown between six to ten orders of
magnitude. Much of this data is accessible via networks. On the other hand, during this same period the
number of scientists, engineers, and other analysts available to analyze this data has remained relatively
constant. For example, the number of new Ph.D.’s in statistics graduating each year has remained
relatively constant during this period. Only one conclusion is possible: either most of the data is destined
to be write-only, or techniques, such as data mining, must be developed, which can automate, in part, the
analysis of this data, filter irrelevant information, and extract meaningful knowledge.Hardware Trends. Data mining requires numerically and statistically intensive computations on large
data sets. The increasing memory and processing speed of workstations enables the mining of data sets
using current algorithms and techniques that were too large to be mined just a few years ago. In addition,
the commoditization of high performance computing through SMP workstations and high performance
workstation clusters enables attacking data mining problems that were accessible using only the largest
supercomputers of a few years ago.
Network Trends. The next generation internet (NGI) will connect sites at OC-3 (155 MBits/sec) speeds
and higher. This is over 100 times faster than the connectivity provided by current networks. With this
type of connectivity, it becomes possible to correlate distributed data sets using current algorithms and
techniques. In addition, new protocols, algorithms, and languages are being developed to facilitate
distributed data mining using current and next generation networks.
Scientific Computing Trends. As mentioned above, scientists and engineers today view simulation as a
third mode of science. Data mining and knowledge discovery serves an important role linking the three
modes of science: theory, experiment and simulation, especially for those cases in which the experiment
or simulation results in large data sets.
Business Trends. Today businesses must be more profitable, react quicker, and offer higher quality
services than ever before, and do it all using fewer people and at lower cost. With these types of
expectations and constraints, data mining becomes a fundamental technology, enabling businesses to
more accurately predict opportunities and risks generated by their customers and their customers’
transactions.
7. Research Challenges
In this section, we describe some of the major research challenges identified by the three workshops.
The research challenges are arranged into five broad areas: A) improving the scalability of data mining
algorithms, B) mining non-vector data, C) mining distributed data, D) improving the ease of use of data
mining systems and environments, and E) privacy and security issues for data mining.
A. Scaling data mining algorithms. Most data mining algorithms today assume that the data fits into
memory. Although success on large data sets is often claimed, usually this is the result of sampling large
data sets until they fit into memory. A fundamental challenge is to scale data mining algorithms as
1. the number of records or observations increases;
2. the number of attributes per observation increases;
3. the number of predictive models or rule sets used to analyze a collection of observations increases;
4. and, as the demand for interactivity and real-time response increases.
Not only must distributed, parallel, and out-of-memory versions of current data mining algorithms be
developed, but genuinely new algorithms are required. For example, association algorithms today can
analyze out-of-memory data with one or two passes, while requiring only some auxiliary data be kept in
memory.
B. Extending data mining algorithms to new data types. Today, most data mining algorithms work with
with vector-valued data. It is an important challenge to extend data mining algorithms to work with
other data types, including 1) time series and process data, 2) unstructured data, such as text, 3)semi-structured data, such as HTML and XML documents, 4) multi-media and collaborative data, 5)
hierarchical and multi-scale data, and 6) and collection-valued data.
C. Developing distributed data mining algorithms. Today most data mining algorithms require bringing
all together data to be mined in a single, centralized data warehouse. A fundamental challenge is to
develop distributed versions of data mining algorithms so that data mining can be done while leaving
some of the data in place. In addition, appropriate protocols, languages, and network services are
required for mining distributed data to handle the meta-data and mappings required for mining
distributed data. As wireless and pervasive computing environments become more common, algorithms
and systems for mining the data produced by these types of systems must also be developed.
D. Ease of Use. Data mining today is at best a semi-automated process and perhaps destined to always
remain so. On the other hand, a fundamental challenge is to develop data mining systems which are
easier to use, even by casual users. Relevant techniques include improving user interface, supporting
casual browsing and visualization of massive and distributed data sets, developing techniques and
systems to manage the meta-data required for data mining, and developing appropriate languages and
protocols for providing casual access to data. In addition, the development of data mining and
knowledge discovery environments which address the process of collecting, processing, mining, and
visualizing data, as well as the collaborative and reporting aspects necessary when working with data
and information derived from it, is another important fundamental challenge.
E. Privacy and Security. Data mining can be a powerful means of extracting useful information from
data. As more and more digital data becomes available, the potential for misuse of data mining grows. A
fundamental challenge is to develop privacy and security models and protocols appropriate for data
mining and to ensure that next generation data mining systems are designed from the ground up to
employ these models and protocols.
8. Testbeds and Infrastructure
Experimental studies will play a critical role in advancing the field of data mining. Developed testbeds
for high performance and distributed data mining is essential for progress in the field.
The requirements for data mining testbeds are different than those for general purpose high performance
computing testbeds. For example, the computing resources for data mining testbeds are as much
disk-oriented as processor-oriented; the network resources must be able move data sets and data
elements between geographically distributed sites with guaranteed quality of service; and a variety of
general purpose and specialized data mining software must be available.
Perhaps the two most difficult challenges in creating data mining testbeds and national resources in data
mining are assembling a) the appropriate data sets and b) the required interdisciplinary and
multidisciplinary teams.
9. Findings and Recommendations
In this section, we list some of the major findings of these three workshops.
For all interested parties:Data mining and knowledge discovery is a new emerging discipline with both a scientific and
engineering component that is of strategic importance for the U.S. and of critical importance to future
information access technologies. All interested parties are encouraged to work towards the maturation of
data mining and knowledge discovery, towards its establishment as a scientific and engineering
discipline in its own right, and towards the evolution of a community that includes the relevant traditions
and disciplines and puts them together in the proper context.
For the federal government:
1. Create programs which encourage the emergence of data mining and knowledge discovery as an
independent discipline.
2. Support interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research projects. Many advances in data mining
require teams of mathematicians and statisticians, computer scientists, and application domain
scientists working together to create the appropriate data sets and the required algorithms and
software to analyze them.
3. Support basic research in computer and information sciences that underlies data mining, including
machine learning, knowledge systems, data bases, high performance computing, high performance
networking, and digital libraries.
4. Support basic research in mathematics and statistics that underlies data mining, including statistics,
probability, applied mathematics, logic, discrete mathematics, analysis and dynamical systems,
linear algebra, and computational geometry and algebra.
5. Support data mining testbeds. The hardware, software, data and consulting requirements for data
mining often out-strip the resources of individual scientists and small research groups. Supporting
national resources and testbeds for data mining is important in order to provide the proper
experimental infrastructure required for next generation data mining experiments.
For companies:
1. Support applied research in data mining.
2. Work to develop, implement and support appropriate privacy and security models for data mining
systems.
3. Create sanitized versions of real data sets for use by data mining researchers.
4. Support joint research projects between industry and universities. Support collaborative testbeds
and demonstration projects.
For scientists and engineers:
1. As new data is collected and archived, support emerging protocols, languages, and standards to
facilitate the future analysis and mining of the data, especially by scientists and engineers from
other disciplines.2. As new data is collected and as new systems are built to manage it, ensure that the best available
privacy and security models are used to protect inadvertent disclosures of private information.
3. Provide long-term maintenance and access to data sets created by scientists and engineers, as well
as to the knowledge and information extracted from them.
10. Conclusions
Data mining and knowledge discovery are emerging as a new discipline with important applications to
science, engineering, health care, education, and business. Data mining rests firmly on 1) research
advances obtained during the past two decades in a variety of areas and 2) more recent technological
advances in computing, networking and sensors. Data mining is driven by the explosion of digital data
and the scarcity of scientists, engineers, and domain experts available to analyze it.
Data mining is beginning to contribute research advances of its own, by providing scalable extensions
and advances to work in associations, ensemble learning, graphical models, techniques for on-line
discovery, and algorithms for the exploration of massive and distributed data sets.
Advances in data mining requires a) supporting single investigators working in data mining and the
underlying research domains supporting data mining; b) supporting inter-disciplinary and
multi-disciplinary research groups working on important basic and applied data mining problems; and c)
supporting the appropriate testbeds for mining large, massive and distributed data sets.
Appropriate privacy and security models for data mining must be developed and implemented.
