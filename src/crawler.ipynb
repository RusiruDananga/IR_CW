A total of 40 empirical studies met all selection criteria, and \\nwere fully reviewed using multiple methods, including selected bibliometrics, content analysis and categorical \\nmeta-trends analysis. This article reports the current state of AIEd research, highlights selected AIEd technologies \\nand applications, reviews their proven and potential benefits for education, bridges the gaps between AI tech-\\nnological innovations and their educational applications, and generates practical examples and inspirations for \\nboth technological experts that create AIEd technologies and educators who spearhead AI innovations in edu-\\ncation. It also provides rich discussions on practical implications and future research directions from multiple \\nperspectives. The advancement of AIEd calls for critical initiatives to address AI ethics and privacy concerns, and \\nrequires interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaborations in large-scaled, longitudinal research and devel -\\nopment efforts.   \\nSince Alan Turing first articulated the promising vision of “thinking \\nmachines ” in 1950, artificial intelligence (AI) research has been \\nadvanced in many different fields and generated an increasing body of \\nliterature (e.g., Andriessen and Sandberg, 1999 ; Beck et al., 1996 ; Bur-\\nleson & Lewis, 2016 ; Clancey et al., 1979 ; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2019 ; \\nKurzweil, 1985 ; Kurzweil & Kapor, 2002; Kurzweil, 2002; Legg & Hut-\\nter, 2007 ; Simmons & Chappell, 1988 ; Zdenek, 2003 ). In education, \\nemerging technologies have also been transforming ways of teaching \\nand learning. The AI market in US Education Sector is expected to grow \\nby 48% in 2018 –2022 (BusinessWire.com , 2018). With the thrive of AI \\ntechnology, its applications in education have been increasing, with \\npromising potentials to provide customized learning, to offer dynamic \\nassessments, and to facilitate meaningful interactions in online, mobile \\nor blended learning experiences. More provocatively, in response to the \\nteacher shortage in USA, for example, scholars (Edwards & Cheok, \\n2018) have proposed to replace some roles of teachers with robots with \\nAI. \\nThe increasing applications of AI in education (AIEd) demand \\ninterdisciplinary approaches, while most AI research is carried out only \\nin STEM fields (Zawacki-Richter, Marin, Bond & Gouverneur, 2019 ). \\nConsistently, a few recent literature reviews have highlighted the lack of \\neducational perspectives in AIEd research (e.g., Chen, Xie, Zou, & Hwang, 2020 ; Hinojo-Lucena, Aznar-Díaz, C˘aceres-Reche, & Romer -\\no-Rodríguez, 2019 ; Zawacki-Richter, Marín, Bond, & Gouverneur, \\n2019 ). In addition, researchers have voiced concerns about the absence \\nof educational theories and models, as found in AI-enabled e-learning \\nresearch published in the past two decades (Tang, Chang, & Hwang, \\n2021 ). It is also worth noting that AIEd innovations remain at the early, \\nexperimental stage, and there is few collaboration with educational in-\\nstitutions in related interventions such as AI enabled adaptive systems \\n(Kabudi, Pappas, & Olsen, 2021 ). As a result, there has been a critical \\ngap between what AIEd technologies could do and how they are actually \\nimplemented in authentic educational settings (Bates et al., 2020 ; \\nKabudi et al., 2021 ). \\nAs an effort to further advance AI technologies for education, this \\narticle intends to help the broader AIEd community, including educa -\\ntors, educational researchers, AI technology creators and other stake -\\nholders to build a deeper understanding in AIEd, including its current \\nstate, potentials, challenges and future directions. Specifically, this \\ncomprehensive review of related literature aims to achieve the following \\ngoals through multiple analysis methods:  \\n≡to map the landscape of AIEd research publications in recent \\ndecades, \\n*Corresponding author. \\nE-mail addresses: Ke.zhang@wayne.edu (K.

This study in-\\nvestigates the longitudinal growth of empirical studies on AIEd, gener -\\nates the macro, as well as micro viewpoints on AIEd research. Through a \\nbroad overview on the current state of AIEd research, this review also \\ncreates a solid foundation for historical or meta analyses of the \\nincreasing body of research literature on AIEd. More importantly, this \\narticle provides practical takeaways for varied AIEd stakeholders and \\nidentifies new directions for AIEd practice, research, development, \\nimplementation and evaluations. From educational perspectives, this \\nstudy stands out from many other related reviews with the following \\ndifferences:  \\n(a) the scope, as defined by the research questions and inclusion and \\nexclusion criteria,  \\n(b) the selected mixed methods for varied analyses,  \\n(c) highly focused analyses as related to education, and  \\n(d) the implications and discussions from multiple perspectives. \\nThe following research questions guided the multi-phased search, \\nreview and analyses of AIEd research publications in this study:  \\n1. What is the landscape of research publications on AIEd in the Web of \\nScience Database and selected AIEd specialized journals?  \\n2. What are the AIEd Technology applications and their educational \\nbenefits, as reported in eligible research publications?  \\n3. What implications does current research have on future research and \\npractice of AIEd? \\n1.Research methods and process \\nThis multi-phase study critically examines refereed research publi -\\ncations on AI in education. Multi-phase searches and selections were \\nconducted to identify eligible publications for full analyses. \\n1.1. Source databases \\nWith the surge of online publications and open access resources, it is \\nvirtually impossible to conduct an exhaustive search even with well- \\ndefined criteria. This investigation was carefully designed to focus on \\nresearch publications collected in one of the most widely used web- \\nbased databases, the Web of Science (SCI/SSCI). Web of Science (SCI/ \\nSSCI) was chosen as the source database for the following reasons: (1) it \\ncollects journals in both Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science \\nCitation Index (SSCI); (2) the database is highly selective, including \\nregarded journals in both sciences and social sciences; and (3) it is one of \\nthe few comprehensive web-based databases that allow detailed bib-\\nliometric analysis (Okubo, 1997 ). As newer journals may not be included in Web of Science database, \\nadditional search efforts were made to locate more, recent publications \\non AIEd-specialized journals. The following three specialized journals \\nwere selected as additional source databases, International Journal of \\nArtificial Intelligence in Education , International Journal of Learning Ana-\\nlytics and Artificial Intelligence for Education and Computers & Education: \\nArtificial Intelligence . \\n1.2. Searches and selections \\nMultiple rounds of searches were conducted on the source database \\nusing different combinations of key words and search strategies, such as \\n“AI”, “artificial intelligence ”, and “education ”. Three rounds of searches \\non Web of Science yielded a total of 507 articles initially, from which 27 \\nduplicates, one conference paper, and two non-English articles were \\nexcluded in the initial screening. In addition, searches were conducted \\non the three selected journals ’ websites for research articles published \\ntill 2020, using the same search strategies. \\n1.2.1. Selection criteria and results \\nIn order to achieve the specified research goals, a set of selection \\ncriteria were established and applied for inclusion and exclusion. Only \\nEnglish, refereed journal articles reporting empirical, evidence-based \\nstudies were selected for further analyses. The following were \\nexcluded: (a) non-English publications, (b) conference proceedings or \\npresentations, (c) theoretical or conceptual articles, (d) reports of per-\\nsonal user experiences, (e) articles reporting no data or without enough \\ndata, (f) research without human participants, (g) studies not related to \\neducation or artificial intelligence, and (h) quantitative studies with less \\nthan 20 participants. \\nIn addition, the following criteria were followed strictly in the \\nscreening and selection process: 1. Research must focus on AI in \\neducational settings. Published research on AI in the consumer market, \\nengineering, health care systems and other non-educational settings was \\nthus excluded; 2. Research must be data-supported empirical studies. \\nArticles that were solely based on personal opinions or anecdotal ex-\\nperiences were excluded; 3. Research must have investigated educa -\\ntional effects of AI by reporting relevant qualitative or quantitative data. \\nPapers that did not provide any evidence on learning were excluded; 4. \\nResearch must have sufficient participants with a large enough sample \\nsize. Experimental or quasi experimental studies or survey research with \\nless than 20 participants were thus excluded; 5. Theoretical, conceptual \\nand literature review papers were also excluded for full analyses, but \\nthey were carefully read to strengthen our background knowledge and \\nto broaden the theoretical foundation for developing a general under -\\nstanding of AI in education. \\nThe researchers reviewed all search results together and reached \\nconsensus on inclusion or exclusion of each article. After careful \\nscreenings and initial analyses, a total of 40 research articles were \\nselected for full analyses, including 34 articles from Web of Science, five \\nfrom International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, and one \\nfrom Computers & Education: Artificial Intelligence . No eligible articles \\nwere identified from the International Journal of Learning Analytics and \\nArtificial Intelligence for Education . \\n1.3. Analysis methods \\nBibliometrics have been widely applied to evaluate research publi -\\ncations through quantitative analyses to measure varied indicators (e.g., \\nKeshaval & Gowda 2008; Okubo, 1997 ; Thelwall, 2008 ). More recently, \\nresearchers have also conducted content analysis to address the \\ndisparity between quantitative and qualitative approaches in reviewing \\nresearch publications (e.g., Gao et al., 2012 ; Hung & Zhang, 2012 ; Mogil \\net al., 2009 ). Thus, in this study, selected bibliometrics (Okubo, 1997 ), \\ncategorical meta-trend analysis (Hung & Zhang, 2012 ; Thelwall, 2008 ) \\nand inductive content analysis (Gao et al., 2012 ; Mogil et al., 2009 ) were K. Zhang and A.B. Aslan                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\nComputers and Education: Artificial Intelligence 2 (2021) 100025\\n3conducted. \\nThe researchers reviewed each eligible article and analyzed them to \\nidentify the followings: bibliometrics, setting of the study, participants \\nprofile, sample size, country of the study, AI technology applications and \\neffects in education, and implications on AIEd. The researchers collab -\\noratively developed a coding system for this review. Major codes \\nincluded bibliometrics of the publication (e.g., year of publication, name \\nof the journal, etc.), countries where studies were carried out, educa -\\ntional setting of the study, (e.g., K-12 or higher education), subject area \\nin which a particular AI technology was implemented and researched (e. \\ng., engineering, psychology, etc.), participants profile (e.g., grade level, \\nage, demographics, etc.), number of participants, specific AI technology \\napplications and their educational benefits as reported in the study. Both \\nresearchers discussed on the coding, categorization and themes emerged \\nin the process and resolved any disagreements through discussions to \\nbuild shared understandings. The collaborative approach throughout \\nmultiple analyses ensured a high reliability and trustworthiness of the \\nreview. \\n2.Results \\n2.1. The landscape of AIEd research publications \\nBibliometric analyses (e.g. Keshaval & Gowda 2008; Okubo, 1997 ; \\nThelwall, 2008 ), categorical meta-trend analysis (Hung & Zhang, 2012 ; \\nThelwall, 2008 ) and inductive content analysis were conducted on all \\neligible research articles. The following summarizes the AIEd research \\nanalyzed in this study. \\n2.1 Prolific countries. Artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) \\nresearch has been conducted in many countries around the world. The \\n40 articles reported AIEd research studies in 16 countries (See Table 1). \\nUSA was so far the most prolific, with nine articles meeting all criteria \\napplied in this study, and noticeably seven of them were conducted in K- \\n12. Followed was China with seven AIEd articles. Two of them were \\nconducted in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the early \\n2000s (i.e., Cheung, Hui, Zhang, & Yiu, 2003 ; Xu & Wang, 2006 ), and \\ntwo took place in Taiwan (Hwang, Sung, Chang, & Huang, 2020 ; Shih, \\nChang, Chen, Chen, & Liang, 2012 ), including one study in 2012, a few \\nyears before the global research community caught up with the surge of \\nAIEd publications in 2015. More recently, scholars in mainland China \\nalso conducted large-scaled AIEd research in 2017 (Xie, Zheng, Zhang, & \\nQu, 2017 ) and 2018 (Wei, Yang, Chen, & Hu, 2018 ). \\nTurkey and Spain tied as the third most prolific countries, each with \\nfive AIEd studies, and they were all in the recent years. Interestingly to \\nnote, while UK had the first AIEd study (Kelly, Sleeman, & Gilhooly, \\n1993 ) in 1993, that was also the only one from UK. Other countries \\ncontributing to the increasing body of AIEd research included Australia, \\nBrazil, Canada, France, Greece, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, Slovenia, Swe-\\nden, UAE and UK. Remarkably, the Global South is well represented in \\nAIEd research publications. In addition, there was one multinational \\nstudy that took place in United Arab Emirates and Spain (Rapanta & \\nWalton, 2016 ). One AIEd study was executed at a high school in Europe, \\nbut it did not specify which country (Moridis & Economides, 2009 ). \\n2.2. Educational settings \\nThe reviewed articles reported various empirical studies in both K-12 \\n(n \\x8817) and higher education systems (n \\x8821). Articles did not specify \\nthe educational settings in which they were carried out were not \\nincluded in Table 2. \\n2.3. Subject areas \\nAI was implemented and examined in a wide variety of subject areas, \\nsuch as science, medicine, arts, sports, engineering, mathematics, \\ntechnologies, foreign language, business, history and more (See Table 1 \\nA summary of countries and participants of AIEd research.  \\nCountry/ \\nPlace of Study n Article Participants \\nAustralia 1 Ijaz, Bogdanovych, and \\nTrescak (2017) 60 undergraduate students \\nBrazil 1 Santos and Notargiacomo \\n(2018) 21 volunteers \\nCanada 1 a.

The largest number of AIEd research studies (n \\x8814) were in \\nengineering, computer science, information technology (IT), or infor-\\nmatics, followed by mathematics (n \\x888), foreign language (n \\x884), \\nscience (n \\x883), and business (n \\x883). In total, 25 of the 40 research \\nstudies were conducted in STEM fields. Three studies investigated AIEd \\nin multiple disciplines (i.e., Cheung et al., 2003 ; Dias et al., 2015 ; Xie \\net al., 2017 ). Articles did not specify the subject areas addressed in the \\nstudy were not in Table 3. \\n2.4. Collaborations in AIEd research \\nMost of the AIEd research articles were outcomes of collaborative work with two or more authors. Among the 40 research articles \\nreviewed in this study, only two empirical studies were single authored \\n(Arpaci, 2019 ; K\\x7fose, 2017 ). Collaborative research on AIEd involved not \\nonly multiple authors but also multiple disciplines (e.g., Cheung et al., \\n2003 ; Dias et al., 2015 ; Xie et al., 2017 ), and sometimes in multiple \\ncountries (e.g., Rapanta & Walton, 2016 ) as well. \\n2.5. Participants and sample sizes \\nThe sample sizes of the AIED research varied greatly, ranging from \\n20 (Zheng, Zhang Xu, Peng, & Wu, 2018 ) to 7341 (Xie et al., 2017 ), as \\nnoted in Table 1. Most of the studies had a sample size of 100–500 (n \\x88\\n24), and three studies had sample sizes larger than 1000 (i.e., Dias et al., \\n2015 , Flogie & Abersek, 2015 ; Xie et al., 2017 ). \\nParticipants profiles also varied by study. AIEd research involved \\nparticipants from K-12 schools or higher education institutions (see \\nTable 2), from different countries (see Table 1), in distinct academic \\nprograms or courses (Table 3), and of various social economic states \\n(Table 1). Participants in a study were from different grade levels (e.g., \\nChin et al., 2010 ; Flogie & Abersek, 2015 ; Samarakou et al., 2018 ), from \\nmultiple disciplines (e.g., Cheung et al., 2003 ; Dias et al., 2015 ; Xie \\net al., 2017 ), in different countries (e.g., Rapanta & Walton, 2016 ), \\nincluded both adults and children (e.g., Keshav et al., 2017 ), or involved \\nboth faculty and students (e.g., Cheung et al., 2003 ). \\nStudent diversity was also examined in some AIEd research studies.

In an earlier study in Taiwan, Shih and colleagues (Shih et al., \\n2012 ) studied sixth graders from a school with lower socioeconomic \\nstatus, in comparison to other schools in the same region. Also, in some \\nresearch, both teachers and students were studied. For example, in a \\nstudy in Slovenia, the researchers examined the effects of a trans -\\ndisciplinary cognitive neuro-educational model on the attitudes of both \\nstudents and teachers toward school (Flogie & Abersek, 2015 ). In sum, \\nAIEd research was conducted with participants representing diverse \\npopulations in different countries, in various educational settings and in \\nan array of subject areas. \\n3.AIEd technology applications & educational benefits \\nAI technology brings virtually unlimited possibilities to education. \\nThe 40 articles investigated a wide variety of AI applications in educa -\\ntion, including the following types of learning technology: \\n≡Chatbot (Fryer et al., 2017 ); \\n≡Expert systems (Dias et al., 2015 ; Hwang et al., 2020 ); \\n≡Intelligent tutors or agents (Cheung et al., 2003 ; Chin et al., 2010 ; \\nChin et al., 2013 ; Cung, Xu, Eichhorn, & Warschauer, 2019 ; Gulz et al., \\n2020 ; K\\x7fose & Arslan, 2016 ; Matsuda et al., 2020 ; McCarthy et al., 2018 ; \\nMcLaren, DeLeeuw, & Mayer, 2011 ; T\\x7farning, Silvervarg, Gulz, & Haake, \\n2019 ); \\n≡Machine learning (Arpaci, 2019 ; Wei, et a., 2018 ); ≡Personalized learning systems or environments (PLS/E) (Bahçeci & \\nGürol, 2016 ; Griol et al., 2014 ; K\\x7fose, 2017 ; Montalvo et al., 2018 ; \\nSamarakou et al., 2018 ; Santos & Notargiacomo, 2018 ; Xu & Wang, \\n2006 ; Walkington & Bernacki, 2019 ); \\n≡Visualizations (Keshav et al., 2017 ; Leony, Munoz-Merino, Pardo, & \\nKloos, 2013 ; Lou-Escande, Frenoy, Poplimont, Thouvenin Gapenne, & \\nMegalakaki, 2017 ) \\n3.1. Chatbot \\nOnly one study focused solely on chatbot in education and it was not \\ndirectly linked to learning outcomes. Through a twelve-week experi -\\nment, researchers tested the effects of chatbot partners, compared to \\nhuman partners, on students ’ course interest in foreign language classes \\nwith 122 students (Fryer et al., 2017 ). The study found that students ’ \\ninterests dropped after one week with chatbot, and the Structural \\nEquation Modelling indicated that task interest predicted future course \\ninterest in human partner conditions, while under Chatbot partner \\nconditions it did not. While researchers attributed the decrease in in-\\nterest to a novelty effect (Fryer et al.), it calls for more empirical studies \\nto examine effects of chatbot in education. \\n3.2. Expert system \\nAIEd research suggested that dynamic, holistic expert systems can \\nhelp with pedagogical planning and fully unleash the potentials of \\nlearning management systems (LMS) for teaching and learning (Dias \\net al., 2015 ). For example, Dias and colleagues researched on the quality \\nof interactions in a blended learning environment with 1037 students \\nand 75 professors in an LMS through multiple courses in an academic \\nyear (Dias et al., 2015 ). Their study proved that the structural charac -\\nteristics of an expert system can model how LMS users interact with it \\n(Dias et al., 2015 ), and thus to facilitate and improve the teaching and \\nlearning experiences on the LMS. In a recent study (Hwang et al., 2020 ), \\nresearchers investigated the effects of a fussy expert system on \\nelementary students ’ math learning outcomes in Taiwan. In this study, \\nstudents in the experimental group outperformed those in the other two \\ngroups in mathematics learning achievement. In addition, the adaptive \\nlearning model with affective and cognitive performance analysis was \\nfound effective in reducing math anxiety amongst the fifth graders in \\nTaiwan (Hwang et al., 2020 ). \\n3.3. Intelligent tutors or agents \\nIntelligent tutors or agents provide customized, timely, and appro -\\npriate materials, guidance, and feedback to learners. With great poten -\\ntials, research indicates mixed implications regarding its effects on \\nlearning. For example, a few studies examined the effects of Teachable \\nAgent (TA) (Chin et al, 2010 , 2013 ; Matsuda et al., 2020 ; T\\x7farning et al., \\n2019 ). Research indicated that TA promoted learning for elementary \\nstudents in different grades (Chin et al, 2010 , 2013 ; Matsuda et al., \\n2020 ) and prepared students to learn new science content from their \\nregular lessons, even when they were not using the AI software (Chin \\net al., 2010 ). More recently, researchers in Sweden (Gulz et al., 2020) \\nstudied preschoolers ’ understanding of a TA-based math game as re-\\nflected in their gaze behaviors. The study indicated that young children \\nperceived the TA as an independent entity, and researchers thus sug-\\ngested that TA was promising in facilitating metacognitive scaffolding \\n(Gulz et al., 2020). In another study, researchers examined the effects of \\nmetacognitive scaffolding by teaching a TA on 7th & 8th graders ’ \\nlearning outcomes (Matsuda et al., 2020 ). They found that students ’ \\nability to solve problems increased with the three TA interventions, but \\nthere was no difference amongst the three different conditions (Matsuda \\net al., 2020 ). Research also suggested that TA with a similar level of \\nself-efficacy with target students may help improve learners ’ perfor -\\nmance in math (T\\x7farning et al., 2019 ).

In another study, McLaren and col-\\nleagues (McLaren et al., 2011 ) found that for students with low prior \\nknowledge, a polite web-based tutor led to more learning as compared to \\nthe regular web-based tutor. \\n3.4. Machine learning \\nDespite the wide applications of machine learning, a small number of \\nresearch studies met all criteria for full analyses in this study. This \\nimportant AI technology was effective in assessing the changes of \\nlearning styles in ESL/EFL in multiple grades (Wei et al., 2018 ). In \\nanother study, machine learning algorithms were used to predict un-\\ndergraduate students ’ attitudes toward educational applications of \\ncloud-based mobile computing services by their information manage -\\nment behaviors with 74% accuracy (Arpaci, 2019 ). \\n3.5. Personalized learning systems or environments (PLS/E) \\nPersonalized learning systems or environments (PLS/E) were found \\neffective in facilitating interactions (Xu & Wang, 2006 ) and improving \\ne-learning experiences (Cheung et al., 2003 ; K\\x7fose, 2017 ; K\\x7fose & Arslan, \\n2016 ; Xu & Wang, 2006 ). Turkish researchers, K\\x7fose and Arslan (2016) \\nstudied the effects of PLS, with 110 undergraduate students through two \\nsemesters in computer programming courses. They found the PLS system \\nhelped learners to achieve desirable learning outcomes and reportedly \\nimproved their learning experiences as well. In another study, K\\x7fose \\n(2017) also found that personalized mobile learning, via AI and \\nAugmented Reality (AR), improved learning experiences as well as \\nlearning outcomes in open computer education. A study with over 1300 \\nparticipants in Hong Kong investigated an AI-enhanced e-learning sys-\\ntem called SmartTutor (Cheung et al., 2003 ). And, it was found that \\ncustomized learning materials and resources were well received and \\nboth students and faculty confirmed that they were helpful in the \\nteaching/learning process (Cheung et al., 2003 ). A study with high \\nschool students in USA (Walkington & Bernacki, 2019 ) found that \\nconnecting math to students ’ personal interests that were not \\nschool-related would increase learning in an intelligent tutoring system, \\nand thus highly customized personalization could promote learning and \\nthus may lead to student success. \\n3.6. Visualizations and virtual learning environments (VLE) \\nTogether with the surge of virtual reality (VR) technologies, research \\nhas started exploring the potential benefits of visualizations and VLE \\nwith AI in education. Evidently, students enjoyed the learning experi -\\nence in VLE and reported that it facilitated learning and collaborations \\n(Griol et al., 2014 ). Similarly, teachers also noted that students were \\nbetter engaged in learning (Griol, Molina, & Callejas). A technology \\ncombining both AI and virtual reality (VR) was found effective in \\nimproving the learning experience and engaging the young generation \\nof learners in Australia (Ijaz et al., 2017 ). Undergraduate students \\nlearning with AI and VR also performed better in comprehensions as \\nmeasured in this study (Ijaz et al., 2017 ). A study on a smart glass system \\nalso confirmed that AI technology with visualizations helped both \\nchildren and adults with autism, by serving as a social communication \\naid (Keshav et al., 2017 ). However, supplementary visual feedback in a \\nmixed reality (MR) environment led to a cognitive load for participants \\nwhen learning calligraphy, yet without effect on user experience (Lou-\\np-Escande et al., 2017 ). The inconsistent research results call for im-\\nprovements in this type of AI technology and demand more research on \\nAI visualizations and VLE. 4.Discussions \\n4.1. AI in education: technologies & benefits \\nAs early as 1991, Garito has stressed that AI is changing the tradi-\\ntional role of a teacher (Garito, 1991 ). Lately, more scholars point out \\nthat AI empowers educators with better ways to teaching and learning \\n(Cope, Kalantzis, & Searsmith, 2020). With scalable applications, AI is \\ntransforming educational practices with profound impacts across the \\nworld, including the Global South and in emergent forms of education \\nlike MOOCs, blended learning, flipped classrooms and more (e.g., Al \\nBraiki, Harous, Zaki, & Alnajjar, 2020 ; Reynolds, Reeves, Bonk, & \\nZhang, 2020 ; Roschelle, Lester, & Fusco, 2020 ; Zhang, Bonk, Reeves, & \\nReynolds, 2020 ). \\nA recent review (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019 ) summarizes an array \\nof AIEd applications for varied purposes, such as learner profiling, \\nperformance prediction, assessment, evaluation, personalization, adap-\\ntive learning and more. Evidently, AI systems can analyze student input \\nand provide corrective feedback instantly (Mirzaeian, Kohzadi, & \\nAzizmohammadi, 2016 ; Roschelle, Lester, & Fusco, 2020 ), generate \\nautomatic scoring and formative assessments (Zhu, Liu, & Lee, 2020 ), \\nand help students with revisions during in the learning process (Lee \\net al., 2019 ). Intelligent tutoring systems can help identify learners ’ \\nstrengths and gaps in their current knowledge base (Zawacki-Richter, \\nMarin, Bond, & Gouverneur, 2019 ). More importantly, intelligent \\nfeedback systems can also measure how people learn, in addition to \\nwhat is learned (Cutumisu, Chin, & Schwartz, 2019 ). Machine learning \\nfor example, can predict at-risk or marginal college students (Chui, \\nFung, Lytras, & Lam, 2020 ) as well as gifted students (Hodges & Mohan, \\n2019 ) with high accuracy, which then empowers educators to intervene \\naccordingly for student successes. \\nAIEd advancement calls for more empirical studies with a particular \\nfocus on AI technologies in real teaching and learning settings (Kabudi \\net al., 2021 ), serving educational needs and purposes. As researchers \\npoint out in a recent literature review, there has been a severe \\ndiscrepancy between the potentials of AIEd and their actual imple -\\nmentations in education (Kabudi et al., 2021 ). To illustrate how AI \\ntechnologies are currently leveraged for various teaching and learning \\npurposes, Fig. 1 highlights some practical examples of AIEd applications \\nfrom the research articles reviewed in this study. It may also serve as a \\nsnapshot of the current practice of AIEd with educational aspirations, \\nwhich in turn may also stimulate more research on AIEd. \\nWith educational goals and objectives in mind, the examples in Fig. 1 \\nshowcase how students and educators may benefit from AI-enhanced \\nlearning systems or experiences. \\n4.2. Practical implications for AIEd \\nWith a wide range of technologies, features and functions, the \\nadvancement of AI brings exciting opportunities to education. To realize \\nits full potential for education, it is critical to bridge the gaps between AI \\ntechnological innovations and its educational applications. Fig. 2 sum-\\nmarizes some of the most widely applied AIEd technologies and their \\nproven or potential benefits for education. For learners, AIEd may \\nfacilitate varied interactions, increase learner engagement, generate \\nadaptive learning materials, offer meta-cognitive prompts, provide \\nenriched learning environments, and improve learning outcomes. For \\neducators and administrators, AIEd may provide predictive models, \\nidentify gifted or at-risk students, monitor the learning progress, create \\npersonalized learning materials, assessments and feedback, and analyze \\nscaled data instantly for evaluation or administrative purposes. AI- \\nenhanced learning environments may improve the LMS for both in-\\nstructors and students through expert systems, generate visual feedback, \\nand enrich the learning experience with visualization and immersive \\ntechnologies. \\nWith highlighted practical takeaways, Fig. 2 can serve in multiple K. Zhang and A.B. Aslan                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\nComputers and Education: Artificial Intelligence 2 (2021) 100025\\n7ways to guide both technological experts that create AI technologies for \\neducation as well as educators and educational researchers, who \\nspearhead AI innovations in educational systems through practice, \\nevaluation and research. AI technology inventers, for instance may note \\nits educational benefits and collaborate with educators to leverage AI \\ntechnologies with specific goals to improve learning and teaching on a \\nlarge scale. Likewise, educators, or educational institutions, may iden-\\ntify appropriate AI technologies from the figure for varied educational \\nneeds or goals, without being overwhelmed by the technical details. \\nAlso highlighted in Fig. 2 are some key challenges in promoting \\nAIEd, such as costs & scalability, ethics & privacy, the lack of actionable \\nguidelines for educators, and limited AI expertise among educators. The \\nfigure may further facilitate meaningful communications amongst \\nstakeholders with different areas of expertise (e.g., technological skills \\nvs. learning theories and pedagogies), from different perspectives (e.g., \\ntechnology advancement, teaching and learning, administrations of \\neducational systems, educational research, etc.) and thus lead to fruitful collaborations in AIEd research, development, implementation and \\nevaluation. \\nRecent research has found that students ’ task engagement and per-\\nformance increased when AI-supported systems also attended to their \\naffective status in addition to cognitive aspects (Hwang et al., 2020 ). The \\nstudy demonstrates the potential of AI in addressing learners ’ affective \\nor emotional needs, which in turn may improve learning. It also suggests \\nthe need for more inclusive designs of AIEd technologies to address \\nstudents ’ varied needs and preferences. \\nRecent reviews on AIEd related research have consistently empha -\\nsized the lack of educational perspectives in AIEd research, development \\nor implementations (Chen et al., 2020 ; Hinojo-Lucena et al., 2019 ; \\nKabudi et al., 2021 ; Tang et al., 2021 , ; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019 ). \\nThus, to further advance AI technologies for education, perhaps the most \\nimportant initiative is to invite educators and educational researchers to \\nfully participate in the technological innovation process, to proactively \\nseek input from the educational communities, and to integrate \\nFig. 1.Practical Examples of AIEd applications.  K. Zhang and A.B. Aslan                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\nComputers and Education: Artificial Intelligence 2 (2021) 100025\\n8theoretical, conceptual, practical and empirical support from educa -\\ntional literature. \\n4.3. Directions for future research on AIEd \\nThe booming of AI technology in 2016 highlighted with tech com-\\npanies bringing AI home and the famous AlphaGo with an over-\\nwhelming win over a professional world champion in the Go game (Dee \\npmind.com , n. d.). AIEd research has yet to catch up with the rapid \\nadvancement of AI technology to provide evidence-based guidelines and \\nsupport for AI applications in education. Despite the advancement of \\nAIEd technologies, there is still a lack of educational perspectives in \\nAIEd research, as recent literature reviews have stressed (e.g., Chen \\net al., 2020 ; Hinojo-Lucena et al., 2019 ; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019 ). \\nInterdisciplinary research with educators and educational researchers \\nwill more likely result in feasible practical guidelines and good examples \\nfor fellow educators. In addition, to reach the full potentials of AI in education, collaborative research focusing on AI technology applica -\\ntions that may result in direct or indirect effects on learning outcomes in \\nreal educational settings is particularly vital. \\nResearch also needs to scale up to examine AIEd on the institutional, \\nregional and national levels, and for longer time durations. In addition, \\nemerging methods like educational data mining, text mining, learning \\nanalytics, data visualizations are also imperative to advance AIEd \\nresearch. In particular, emerging educational research methods, such as \\neducational design research (EDR) (McKenney & Reeves, 2018 ), is \\nhighly recommended for research on innovative technologies like AIEd, \\nbecause it empowers educators to incorporate their research inquiries as \\npart of the technology development and implementation cycle in \\nauthentic settings. EDR can be particularly powerful when educators \\nparticipate during the stages of AI technology creation, development or \\nevaluations for educational purposes. \\nAmongst the range of AIEd technologies, some have been studied \\nmore frequently than others. For example, a lot of research focused on \\nFig. 2.Proven and potential educational benefits of AI technologies.  K. Zhang and A.B. Aslan                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\nComputers and Education: Artificial Intelligence 2 (2021) 100025\\n9intelligent tutors or personalized learning systems/environments, while \\nonly a very limited number of research publications examined the effect \\nof chatbot or machine learning in education, as found in this review. \\nThus, future research should cover more AIEd technologies, especially \\nthose have not received much attention in research. \\nAs emerging technologies such as VR, AR or MR being integrated \\nwith AI for various learning supports (e.g., K\\x7fose, 2017 ; Ijaz et al., 2017 ; \\nLoup-Escande et al., 2017 ), it is also vital to conduct research through \\ninterdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaborations as researchers \\nhave suggested (Zhang & Aslan, 2020 ) for successful AIEd development, \\nimplementation and research. \\n4.4. AIEd ethics & privacy \\nAs educational systems experiment with AI in traditional classrooms, \\nonline or via mobile learning management systems (e.g., Roschelle et al., \\n2020 ; Zhang et al., 2020 ), it is imperative to balance efficiency, benefits, \\nsecurity and many more (Hagendorff, 2019 ; Etzioni and Etzioni, 2017 ; \\nAbrams, Abrams, Cullen, & Goldstein, 2019 ). About 20 years ago, \\nscholars have already started conversations about AIEd ethics (Aiken \\nand Epstein, 2000 ), and giant tech companies are forming their own AI \\nethics panels (Lee, 2019 ). But new educational AI technology requires \\nspecific AI ethics for education. Likewise, privacy is a critical issue yet to \\nbe carefully addressed in AIEd. A recent semi-systematic evaluation of \\n22 AI ethics guidelines has revealed that current guidelines have severe \\nflaws and a range of AI ethics that are critical for AI research, devel -\\nopment and implementation are actually missing or overlooked in such \\nguidelines (Hagendroff, 2020 ). The critical and urgent needs for AIEd \\nethics also call for collaborative efforts from all stakeholders, including \\neducators, administrators, researchers, technology innovators and all \\nsocietal members. \\n4.5. Limitation of this review \\nAs typical with any search engines or strategies, a methodological \\nlimitation of this review is tied to the selection of source database and \\njournals, as well as the specific identifiers used in the search efforts, such \\nas “artificial intelligence ” or “AI”. Research publications that do not \\ninclude AI or “artificial intelligence ” as a descriptor in its title, abstract, \\nsummary or keyword list, as well as those not indexed in the source \\ndatabase thus can be excluded in this review. While conference pro-\\nceedings may include more recent or even ongoing research projects, \\nconsidering their very different selection criteria and review processes, \\nconference proceedings are also excluded in this review. Thus, this re-\\nview is limited in its scope. \\n4.6. Suggestions for future reviews \\nFuture reviews may extend the search scope to include other repu-\\ntable databases, specialized journals, or peer-reviewed conference pro-\\nceedings. Additional key words, such as specific AI technology (e.g., \\nmachine learning) or its educational applications may retrieve more \\nrelevant publications. However, future reviews should also be mindful \\nof the search results, as sometimes publications on other topics, such as \\ngame-based learning also appear in the search results (e.g., Yoon & Kim, \\n2015 ), even though they are not AI-related. Another important consid -\\neration is to carefully differentiate AIEd studies without human subjects \\n(e.g., Liu, Rus, & Liu, 2017 ) or otherwise focus on system development \\nor model testing from research with teachers, students or other human \\nparticipants involved, as such in this review. \\nAs an interdisciplinary field, AIEd has overlaps with a few emerging \\nsub-fields, such as educational data mining, learning analytics and \\ncomputer-based education (Chen et al., 2020 ; Romero & Ventura, 2013 \\n). Future reviews may also choose to alter the scope by focusing on \\nspecific AI technologies or their applications in education, or a sub-field \\nof AIEd, or applying different search strategies and selection criteria, or exploring conference proceedings in addition to peer-reviewed journal \\narticles. Given the integrations of emerging technologies like VR, AR and \\nMR (Zhang & Aslan, 2020 ) and AI (e.g., Keshav et al., 2017 ; Ijaz et al., \\n2017 ), future reviews may also explore both of them together. \\n5.Conclusion \\nAI technology is rapidly advancing and its application in education is \\nexpected to grow rapidly in the near future. In the USA, for example, \\neducation sectors are predicted with an approximate 48% of growth in \\nAI market in the near future, from 2018 to 2022 (BusinessWire.com , \\n2018). AI technologies have great potentials in education, in particular, \\nto increase access to learning opportunities, to scale up personally \\ncustomized learning experiences, and to optimize methods and strate -\\ngies for desired learning outcomes (Reynolds et al., 2020 ; Roschelle \\net al., 2020 ; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019 ). Some scholars have publicly \\nproposed to replace teachers or certain roles of teachers with AI robots \\n((Edwards & Cheok, 2018 ). While their article, Why Not Robot Teachers: \\nArtificial Intelligence for Addressing Teacher Shortage (Edwards & Cheok, \\n2018 ) may cause some uneasiness, discomfort or even fear for many \\npeople; it is gradually becoming a reality. In addition to the intelligent \\ntutors and teachable agents in online or blended learning as reported in \\nAIEd studies (e.g., Cheung et al., 2003 ; Chin et al., 2010 , 2013 ; Cung \\net al., 2019 ; K\\x7fose & Arslan, 2016 ; Mclaren et al., 2011 ), the first AI \\nteaching assistant robots, named Happy Numbers have been working in \\nthe classrooms in USA already. \\nAs Finn has emphasized back in the 1960s, technology is “more than \\nan invention – more than machines. It is a process and a way of thinking ” \\n(Fin, 1960 , p. 6). The integration of AIEd calls for critical awareness of \\nAI ethics and requires interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collabo -\\nrations in large-scaled, longitudinal research. The growing AIEd \\nresearch would result in more practical guidelines and examples for \\neducators, together with new ways of teaching and learning. Despite \\nskepticism, doubts or fears, AIEd continues to open up new possibilities \\nfor innovations in education. \\nStatements on open data and ethics \\nThis literature review article collected all data (i.e., eligible publi -\\ncations) from selected databases from the internet. The datasets created \\nfor the current study (the bibliography of included studies) are available \\nfrom the corresponding author upon request. \\nAs the research does not involve human participants, there is no need \\nto seek ethical approval from a research review committee in the au-\\nthors ’ affiliations. \\nDeclaration of competing interest \\nNone. \\nReferences \\nAbram, M., Abram, J., Cullen, P., & Goldstein, L.

Building on these technologies, this study\\nrefers to machines that are able to perceive, recognize,\\nlearn, react, and solve problems as artiﬁcial intelligence(AI) [1, 2]. Inevitably, such smart technologies will rev-olutionizetheworkplacesofthefuture[3].*us,whileAIcaninteractandhelphumansperformathigherlevels,itisemerging as the next disruptive innovation [4]. AI iscurrentlyviewedbymanyasadriverthatisintegraltothefourthindustrialrevolution,anditmaytriggerthefourthrevolutionineducation.LearningaboutAIhasalsobeguntobepartofschoolcurriculum[5,6].However,justastheemergenceoftelevisionandcomputerswasoncetoutedtobe game changers of education, they have been shown toin fact enhance access to information without substan-\\ntially changing the core educational practices. Nonethe-\\nless, educators are obliged to review current AIcapabilities and identify possible pathways to optimizelearning. Given the increasing attention, it is timely toreview recent AI research in education to provide edu-cators with an updated understanding of the ﬁeld as apreparation to possible changes.Hindawi\\nComplexity\\nVolume 2021, Article ID 8812542, 18 pages\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8812542\\nAI has been increasingly propagated as having strategic\\nvalue for education [7]. Loeckx [8] suggested that AI could\\nbeaneﬀectivelearningtoolthatlessenstheburdensofbothteachers and students and oﬀers eﬀective learning experi-ences for students. Coupled with current education reformssuch as the digitalization of educational resources, gamiﬁ-\\ncation, and personalized learning experiences, there are\\nmany opportunities for the development of AI applicationsin education. For example, the modelling potential of AItechniques has been exploited systematically to developreactive and adaptive tutorials for the construction of in-dividualizedlearningenvironmentsascompensationfortheshortage of teachers through the use of intelligent tutoringsystem (ITS) [10]. ITSs provide personalized learning ex-perience in four main ways: monitoring student’s input,delivering appropriate tasks, providing eﬀective feedback,and applying interfaces for human-computer communica-\\ntion [7]. Whenmore ITSsare created for moresubjects and\\ntopics, it is likely to change the role of teachers, and hence,schooling may need to be reconceptualized. *ere existmany concerns and worries among teachers on if AIchallenges their jobs. At the same time, such questions aswhat is being learned and how AI is being used are beingdiscussed currently by researchers as well as by educationalpractitioners. Some researchers wondered whether ad-vancements in AI would challenge or even replace teacherssincemanyotherjobsarebeingreplacedbyautomation[11].*ere is an emerging recognition that teachers’ professionalrolesneedtobeadjustedasAIadvancesandthiswilltrigger\\nnew organizational forms [12]. Emerging challenges also\\nincluded students’ attitudes towards these changes [13]. Tosome extent, students as digital citizens are able to leverageAItoimprovelearningoutcomes.Nonetheless,theymayfailto use suitable AI techniques appropriately for a speciﬁclearning context, which would result in negative attitudestowards learning [14].\\nTo summarize, this research involves a review of the\\nstudies of AI in education. Previous studies have includedthree essential perspectives of AI in knowledge processing:(a)knowledgerepresentation,(b)knowledgeobtaining,and\\n(c) knowledge derivation [3]; this review will focus on AI\\ntechniques and tools that have been integrated into edu-cation recently after the proliferation of AI. *e “ﬁrstgeneration”ofAIcouldsupporthumanintellectualworkbyapplying rule-based expert knowledge, and the “secondgeneration” may ﬁnd the optimal solution by statistical/search model, while the “third generation” will dramaticallyimproverecognitionperformancebasedonthebrainmodel.*is review focuses on articles published in the period from2010to2020fromtheWebofScience,asthatrepresentstheperiodwhenthesecondandthirdgenerationofAIbeganto\\nmake headways into education. *e research questions that\\nguided this review are as follows:\\n(1) What is the overall state of AI in education? Which\\nresearch topics and research designs related to AI ineducation are evident from 2010 to 2020?\\n(2) What are the trends in published studies in terms of\\nAI in education?(3) What are the challenges generated from the current\\nresearch of AI in education?\\n2.Method\\n*isstudyisasystematicliteraturereview.*eobjectivesofthe review were to analyze and interpret ﬁndings based onpredeﬁnedresearchquestions(seeabove)andcriteriawhichserve to point out future directions [15]. *e predeﬁnedresearch foci as shown in Table 1 are research purpose,\\nlearning subject, educational level, research approach, and\\neﬀects. *e review was conducted in three stages: planning,performing, and reporting the systematic review.\\n2.1.PlanningtheReview. AspreviousreviewsaboutAIwere\\nconducted in the physical sciences [16, 17], the study aimed\\nto conduct a review in the ﬁeld of the social sciences.\\n*e Web of Science database and the Social Science\\nCitation Index (SSCI) journals were selected for the searchfor desired articles published from 2010 to 2020. Articlespublished in the SSCI database are generally considered ashigh-quality publication among education researchers. *ekeyword employed was “artiﬁcial intelligence,” and thesubject area was reﬁned to “education and educational re-search”. *is process yielded 142 articles including 121 re-search articles, 10reviewpapers, oneinterviewpaper,and 5book reviews. *e selected articles include both analyticstudies(primarilyqualitativeresearch)andempiricalstudies(primarily quantitative research).\\n2.2. Performing the Review. Following Wu et al. [18], this\\nstudywasconductedintwosteps:identiﬁcationandcoding.\\nIn the ﬁrst step, an article was selected to the potential poolwhen it qualiﬁed for either of two criteria: (a) the researchinvolved a speciﬁc AI technique as an intervention inassisting learning or teaching and (b) it provided empiricalevidenceorin-depthanalysis.Asalreadynoted,onlyarticles\\nindexed in SSCI were considered. It should be noted that\\nstudies that focused on the development processes of AIwithout educational implications or only adopted AI as alearning subject without the employment of AI were ex-cluded from this review. Second, as for the analytic studies,only studies that discussed the eﬀect of AI techniques oneducation were included. Each full text of all the identiﬁedpapers was read and screened individually by three-panelmemberswithdoctoraldegreesorprofessorshipsintheﬁeldof learning technology. Studies that did not ﬁt clearly withthe criteria were brought up for panel discussion. *e\\nscreening process yielded 100 articles out of the original set\\nof 121.\\nIn the second step, all the authors discussed thematic\\nanalysisprinciplesandestablishedacodingschemeintermsofhowAIwasusedineducation.Twomaincategorieswereinvestigated: research questions and technology adoption.Firstly, with regard to research questions, previous researchhasfoundthreebasicmodelsofAIinknowledgeprocessing:knowledge representation, knowledge obtaining, andknowledge derivation [3].

Additionally,35 reviewed studies were found in the dimension of ex-traction, which referred to the application of developed AItechniques,normallybasedonalgorithms,tooﬀerstudentsfeedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning. 14 empiricalstudies were found in the dimension of application whichconsisted of aﬀection computing, role-playing, immersivelearning, and gamiﬁcation. In the integration dimension,AI techniques included those involving human factors asvitalvariablestoidentifyandanalyzelearners’personalized\\nfeatures.Insuchstudies,human-computerinteractionwas\\ngenerated to improve such characteristics as creativity,responsibility, and critical thinking that can impactlearners’ performances and perceptions. *e followingsectionsdescribewhateducationalissuesweredealtwithinthe age of AI and how AI technique was employed in eachresearch question.\\n3.1. Dimension of Development. As shown in Table 2, 16\\nempirical studies were found focusing on the development\\nof education systems such as intelligent tutoring system(ITS) and electronic assessment. *e development proce-dure was usually conducted with an induction-deductionapproach, in which prior experiments and data were ana-lyzed to predict the variables followed by the algorithmtesting to obtain the ﬁnal modelling equation [19].Generally, the development of an educational system is\\nconstituted of three components: the presentations, logicalmodelling, and data dimension [20]. All the 23 studiescentered on logical modelling, while no study was found onthe presentation methods or data mining. *e possibleexplanation may due to that the modelling techniques were\\nthefoundationofAItechniqueandfundamentallypenetrate\\nthroughout the procedure of system development. In thisdimension, the research was generally conducted in thedomainofcomputerscienceorinformationscience,andthedomainknowledgeasthesourcematerialwasimportedintoalgorithmframe(showninFigure1(a))withfewpedagogicaldesigns reported. For example, Horakova et al. [3] aimed toexplore the classiﬁcation ability of a text mining machineusing three classiﬁcation techniques. *e results show thatartiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) were signiﬁcantly moreeﬀective than regression trees and decision trees to separate\\neducational texts or text fragments.\\nAdditionally, in terms of the matching/group formation\\nmodelling, prior research employing stereotype theory has\\nassessed that the Bayesian networks, association rules,clustering, fuzzy C-means, and the fuzzy and genetic al-gorithmswerewell-acceptedalgorithmsforthemodellingofindividual properties of the student. *ese techniquesprovide potential indications for the investigation offorming homogeneous and heterogeneous groups in aneducational context [21].\\nMoreover, the trends of the growing amount of data\\nchallenge educators to analyze qualitative data eﬃciently.\\nNatural language processing (NLP) provided a means to\\ndiagnose the problem and make a recommendation bysimplifyingandacceleratingthediscoveryofwhatlieswithinthe data [22]. However, the assessment of a complex edu-cational system requires more profound information re-trieval. *e integration of multiple approaches, such asbenchmark in NLP/Semantic Web ﬁeld, was suggested tomodel smarter computer-aided systems in which agentscould be trained automatically [23].\\nTo optimize the modelling in the learning context, the\\nhierarchical structures were considered as potential solu-\\ntions to model the educational system. *is is because ed-\\nucationisgenerallyacomplexsystem withtheexhibitionofsubsystems and components, in which the invisible causalprocesses among subsystem/component behaviours wouldcausally aﬀect each other [24]. It was suggested that sys-tematic modelling should analyze three dimensions in theeducationcontext:learner’svariation,learningdomains,andlearning activities [25, 26]. For example, some researchersconstructed the higher-order item response theory frame-work involving the overall ability at the ﬁrst dimension andmultiple domain abilities at the second dimension, which\\nhas been well adopted in the automatic problem-solving\\nprocess [27].\\nBased on the above and Nguyen and Yang’s suggestion\\n[28], the aims of developing an AI-integrated system ineducationcouldbegrouped intofourtypes:classiﬁcation(5studies), matching (3 studies), recommendation (5 studies),anddeeplearning(10studies).(1)Classiﬁcationreferstothereconstruction of knowledge bases, in which the materialsComplexity 7\\n 8503, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/8812542 by Sri Lanka National Access, Wiley Online Library on [22/11/2024].

For example,some researchers developed an ITS with the characteristicsof categorizing motion problems, by which learners couldeasily access diﬀerent types of motion problems in Math-\\nematics [29]. (2) Matching refers to a conversion mecha-\\nnism, in which varied sets of classiﬁcation are connected tospeciﬁc learning purpose. For example, a text-to-diagramsystem was developed for blind students to link geometrywords to an underlying diagram on the Braille printout,which has been certiﬁed as an eﬀective teaching/learningtool at a Blind school [30]. (3) *e recommendation isregarded as an intelligent authoring tool. With the supportofthenaturallanguageprocess,itcouldautomaticallycreatenew themes, theories, and pedagogical contents as a re-sponse to learners’ feedback, to help teachers save time and\\neﬀort [31]. It constructed a human-computer interaction\\nand widely used to generate real-time and intelligentfeedback according to learners’ input, which has beenregarded as a reliable feature in modern assessment system[32]. (4) Deep learning, or machine learning, is a compre-hensive approach of big data processing and learning be-haviour analysis. Based on the proliferation of big data ineducation, such as learning or teaching behaviour, thesystem could self-adjust to meet users’ dynamic require-ments by upgrading its algorithms [33].\\nTo date, some studies have reported the lack of signif-\\nicant impact on improving teaching. *e challenge was\\nlargelyattributedtotheweakpedagogicaldesignandlackof\\nappropriate assessment criteria [8]. Future research shouldtherefore be grounded in learning theories so that moreacceptable, accessible, and eﬃcacious AI can be an integralpart of learners’ lives.\\n3.2. Dimension of Extraction. Educators have begun to ex-\\nploresuitableapplicationsofAItechniquesintheirteaching.\\n*erearecurrentlysomeAIapplicationsthathaveachieved\\nthe integration of technique, domain knowledge, and ped-\\nagogical design. *e three types of pedagogical applicationsof AI identiﬁed in this review were feedback (16 studies),reasoning (10 studies), and adaptive learning (9 studies).While these applications could be interlinked, they werecategorized as such based on the classiﬁcation explicated bythe authors of the reviewed articles.\\n3.2.1. Feedback. One of the challenges impairing person-\\nalized learning is the inappropriate sequencing of contents.\\n*erestructuringofpresentationsequencesisseekingaway\\nto redeﬁne the organization of knowledge according to thestudent’sreaction.Inthissituation,feedbackisanimportantapproach to meet learners’ proximal learning patterns [9].Using an artiﬁcial neural network, the system providesimmediate feedback according to students’ input to helpthem gradually get access to the abstract concepts andperform practical exercises. Besides, researchers perceived apositive trend towards the system, which may attribute totwo perspectives.(1) Based on Ohlsson’s theory, students can learn from\\nthe feedback generated as the result of an error [34]. In aphysical teaching environment, the teacher could interactwithstudentsimmediatelyasdiﬃcultiesarise.Itis,however,diﬃcult for such just-in-time interaction in an onlinecontext. *e situation requires intelligent algorithms to\\nprovide feedback automatically. For example, with the help\\nof pedagogical agent-based cognitive architecture, the in-telligentvirtuallaboratorywasdevelopedtogiveappropriatefeedback to students who encounter diﬃculties in the lab-oratory [35]. Besides, a learning website, Jutge.org, wasdeveloped with the features of a rich and well-organizedproblem repository. *e website provides instant feedbackandhelpsstudentstoprogressivelysolveproblemsandlearnfrom their mistakes [36]. (2) Immediate feedback promotesactive training in interactive learning environments thatwould beneﬁt learner’s comprehension diagnosis [19]. *e\\nprevious study combined speech recognition, natural lan-\\nguage processing, and machine learning to measure thequality of classroomtalk, inwhich newformsof interactionwere created to provoke thoughts and further shape theeﬀective interaction of the learning environment [37].Another AI system used path traversal algorithms to es-tablish causal chains, by which students were provided withelaborated feedback and hints rather than the correct an-swers. *e learning-by-teaching context was constructed bylearners’ self-organization of interactions and their inter-pretation of feedback [38].\\nAlthough a large number of beneﬁts were reported with\\nrespect to automated feedback of domain knowledge, noresearch in this review had established the connection topedagogical theories. Most of the authors in the develop-ment dimensions were from the computer science domain,whichleadstotheirfocusonthepresentationofsourcedata(domain knowledge) technically without much pedagogicalconsideration.\\n3.2.2. AI-Supported Reasoning. *e recursive feedback may\\nhave the potential to foster learners’ abilities to reason in\\nspeciﬁc ways because the human-computer interaction isabletoengenderamongthestudentsasenseofresponsibilitytowardimprovingtheconstructionofknowledgerepository[39]. *e reconstruction of the knowledge repository wasseen as a process of using modelling to realize pedagogicaldesign as shown in Figure 1(b).

One possible explanation could be that reasoningislargelyinvisibleanditisdiﬃculttoinducetheprocessesofreasoning through the observation of the behaviours. AItechniques such as the visualization technique could beapplied to foster learners’ reasoning.\\nTo help learners improve their reasoning, the graph\\nstructure [29] and learners’ engagement [24] techniquesComplexity 9\\n 8503, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/8812542 by Sri Lanka National Access, Wiley Online Library on [22/11/2024].

For the graph structure, intelligent sys-\\ntemscouldbedevelopedtomakethinkingvisible.Inasense,the simulation approach of the AI technique was employedto mimic thoughts tracking the reasoning visually in realtime. For example, the argument-mapping tools weredesignedtoassistlearnerswithvisualizationofthepremises\\nand conclusions of arguments. *e ﬁndings showed that a\\nsequence of connected arguments was chained together forlearnerstomakeanultimateconclusion[40].Drawingfromthe sociocultural theories of learning in designing AI tosupportstudents’reasoning,Vattametal.[24]reportedthatengagedlearnerscouldbetterunderstandthemultiplelevelsof organization in complex systems. *erefore, students’engagement is an essential aspect to be considered for thedesign of a learning system that aims to support reasoning.\\n*e hierarchical reasoning generated by the intelligent\\nsystemhadbeneﬁcialeﬀectsonstudents’learning.Firstly,it\\nmay help learners to optimize the elucidation of the rela-\\ntionships between the subcomponents of a particular topic.In return, the intelligent reasoning system can be used as aform of evaluation to assess if the student has capturedenough concepts for the given topic [41]. Secondly, thesystem could provide an argumentative interaction whichplacedgreatsigniﬁcanceintheconstructionofcollaborativelearning atmosphere. It is because, as a result of peers’reasoning, learners tend to externalize their arguments andimprove their premises. Jain et al. [41] combined visualizedmapping tool with collaboration scripts. *e design suc-cessfully helped learners to analyze and evaluate opposing\\npositions on contentious topics. Generally, researchers\\nregarded the reasoning visualization tools as valuablescaﬀolds to develop learners’ critical thinking and writing[40].\\nHowever, using AI techniques, including visualization\\nandhierarchicalreasoningmodelling,maybeinadequatetosupportreasoning.*efourstudiesreviewedfocusedontheutilization of modelling to support general reasoning, whilethe reasoning model should be largely domain-speciﬁc[24, 39, 40, 42]. Moreover, there is an unresolved challengein coding learners’ behaviours as far as AI-supported rea-\\nsoning is concerned. *e reasoning process may be more\\neﬀective when learners’ personalized performance is con-sidered. Although the visualized reasoning tools couldperform well in a small-scale group setting, it is diﬃcult toobtain adequate reasoning analysis of the data from a largepopulationbecausethereasoningsystemfailstoadjustitselfautomatically. *erefore, the requirements of dealing withincreasingly large and diverse data demand self-adaptivealternatives [9].\\n3.2.3. Adaptive Learning. Based on the new decentralized\\ntheoriesofAIandsocialcognition,theapparentcomplexity\\nof learners’ behaviour was largely a reﬂection of the com-plexity of the learning environments. *is prompted edu-cators to provide adaptive scaﬀolds for diversiﬁed learningenvironments with various types of learners. Diﬀerent fromthefeedbacksystemthatoﬀersstockresponses,theadaptiveeducational system is a formative and corrective automatedsystem that can adjust itself (target of intervention) to suitindividual learners’ characteristics, needs, and preferences(pedagogical objective) [43]. Although only three empiricalstudieswereidentiﬁedinthisreview,someresearcherswerevery positive to the future promotion of adaptive system inteaching and learning. Technologies such as intelligent\\nspeech recognition and automated writing evaluation [44]\\nhave beentested with promisingﬁndings. Inaddition,therewas substantial evidence showing that adaptive intelligenceenhances learning by automatically enabling learners tolocate and access proximal educational resources with re-spect to navigation and presentation support [45].\\nPrevious research has emphasized that the design di-\\nmension was a worth exploring alternative in the appli-cation of adaptive system [46]. To design successfuladaptive systems in education, curriculum designers andsystem designers have to leverage on to include the\\nmodelling of the problem-solving process in the speciﬁc\\ndomain knowledge andthe use ofbig data[21, 44]. Firstly,the mechanism of the adaptive system connects learners’priordomainknowledgeandtheevaluationoftheircurrentdomain performance to scaﬀold their problem-solving[47]. In particular, the pedagogical design is essential inadaptive intelligent context. It involves the selection ofadaptive algorithms and considerations about the com-patibility of the learning style and the intelligence sup-portive methods. In this sense, the assumption that AIwould threaten the teachers’ position may be unfoundedbecause of teachers’ vital role as curriculum designers.\\nSecondly, the adaptive system is empowered by big data.\\nSince the main feature of the adaptive learning system ispersonalization,accumulationofbigdatasuchastherangeof diverse individual characteristics and learning style andpreferencesisnecessaryforintelligentpersonalizationtoberealized. However, research on personalization in thecontext of the adaptive system is limited to the users’characteristics related to domain knowledge. *e deeperinternal characters, such as human mental status andcreativity, were barely noticed and studied [21]. *ishowever has vital research potential with the development\\nofadvancedAItechniquessuchasbiofeedbacktechniques.\\n3.3. Dimension of Application\\n3.3.1. Technology Adoption in the Application Dimension.\\n*e dimension of application highlights the importance ofincluding human aﬀection in the application of AI in ed-\\nucation. *e latest research has indicated that aﬀection had\\nincreasinglybeenreportedtoexertasigniﬁcantinﬂuenceondecision-making, perception, and learning [48]. Previousstudies on the measurement of learning performance onlyfocusedontwodimensions:learningoutcomes(e.g.,scoringand achievement) and perceptions (e.g., satisfaction andacceptance), whereas other aspects were less noticed. Basedon the maturity of biofeedback technique, such as eye-tracking and EEG, aﬀection computing was increasinglyadopted to investigate students' internal motivations onlearning, such as creativity and responsibility [49, 50].10 Complexity\\n 8503, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/8812542 by Sri Lanka National Access, Wiley Online Library on [22/11/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\\nAccording to the content analysis of the selected papers\\nshown in Table 1, there are ﬁve typical AI techniques that\\nsupportedaﬀectioncomputingandanalysisintheeducationsector. *ey are complex algorithms, visualization, XR(virtual/augmented/mixed reality), wearable technique, andneuroscience.Inmanysituations,theysupportedeachother\\nto construct a smart learning environment and system. (1)\\nComplex algorithms were designed with consideration ofhuman factors rather than the simple combination offunctionalblocks.Fromtheperspectiveofhuman-computerinteraction, the learners should be treated as a knowledgecreator rather than the receiver, which helps to generatepositive aﬀection status. From the perspective of presenta-tion modes, the traditional declarative statements in acomputer system should be replaced by more diversiﬁedverbal presentations such as dialogue, coaching, and gen-erality. (2) Visualization was seen as an optimal method\\nchosen for the solution of complex conception. One of the\\nbeneﬁts of visualization is making complex knowledge en-tertaining, such as game-based learning, in which learners’motivation will be greatly generated. (3) XR includingvirtual/augmented/mixedrealityprovidesahighlysimulatedlearning context, which may be challenging to realize inphysical classrooms. For example, to help learners under-stand complex landforms in geography, XR indulges stu-dents into a lively and creative status.

Although it was still inan exploratory period, it has great potential to advance\\ndomain knowledge in a practical context in daily life. (5)\\nModernneuroscienceexploitshowthebrainworksandthisexpands the research of learning to include the learners’physiological state. Research in this area would enrich un-derstanding about individual variations and could provideadditional avenues to match instruction with the mostoptimal guidance.\\n3.3.2.:eCategoriesoftheApplicationDimension. Withthe\\nsupports of the above ﬁve AI techniques, four types of\\nlearning models were generated with the application ofaﬀection analysis, which was biofeedback (6 studies), role-playing (2 studies), immersive learning (2 studies), andgamiﬁcation (4 studies).\\nAﬀection computing refers to the analysis of human\\nemotions and feelings captured by physical sensors andaﬀective algorithms, which has gained much attention inrecent years. Aﬀection computing enhanced human-com-\\nputer interaction. Based on the facial identiﬁcation, some\\nresearchers improved the intelligent tutoring system bywhich students’ emotional status was detected to give themtimely emotional feedback [51]. Two essential aspects areneededtooptimizetheaﬀectioncomputingtechnique:ﬁrst,teachers have to make timely appropriate instructionaladjustments according to learners’ aﬀective status; second,comprehensive operation of multimode aﬀection sources asa single source is unlikely to provide accurate analysis ofaﬀection. For example, the eye-tracking technique couldcapture learners’ eye ﬁxation to track the attended area, butthe reasons for the foci may be attributed to diﬀerent af-fections such as interest, anxiety, or even distraction. Anadditional source of data such as EEG could help to make amore accurate assessment [52].\\nRole-play is a learning method that inspires students to\\nponder on problems with aﬀections assuming varied roles.\\nSomealgorithmsweredesignedwiththeintegrationofrole-\\nplay into the pedagogical design, where students are taughtby an intelligent agent rather than being taught by thelearning system [39]. Enlisting role-play can enhancelearners’ investment in their interactions with computers.More than that, learners’ sense of responsibility was exertedtowards the intelligent agent, which was consistent with theresearchfromChaseetal.,demonstratingthatstudentsmaywork harder on behalf of their agents than they would forthemselves [53]. Additionally, to motivate students to act asa companion to an intelligent agent, the politeness pre-\\nsentation mode was employed in the intelligent tutoring\\nsystems, which was observed to beneﬁt the needy students[54].*efutureresearchofrole-playmayfocusongrantingaccess to students so that they could customize their rolesand target agents.\\nImmersivelearningisanapproachthatenablesstudents\\nto customize scenes of characters engaging in full-viewlearningsettings.*eenhancementofXR,3Dgraphics,andwearable devices could promote the learning performanceand these are strongly related to immersive aﬀection, whichgenerated students’ academic performance and positiveperceptions, such as excitement, enthusiasm, and creativity.\\nFor example, learners could obtain a high degree of ex-\\ncitementintheimmersivelearningenvironment.Immersiveenvironment can also be coupled with immersive collabo-ration with gestures, emotions, and nonverbal communi-cation [14]. Using immersive learning may also reducestudents’ sense of being intimidated by complex topics andtechnical concepts when they expose to simulated techno-logical and computing issues [55]. Most importantly, manyimmersive learning tools encourage learners’ enthusiasm tocreate and change the environments, which could fostercreativity[56].However,fewstudieswerefoundtoconsider\\ndomainknowledgeasavariable.*epossiblereasonmaybe\\nthat many immersive learning tools were in the explorativestage. Further investigations in speciﬁc domains are eagerlyneeded.\\nGamiﬁcation has emerged as an important theoretical\\nnotion in the education sector. *e most successful ed-ucational games tightly integrate the pedagogical design,domain knowledge, and aﬀection elements with game-play. AI has assisted the integration of the game andknowledge domain, and the further potential is makingthe game adapt to the learners’ behaviours and aﬀections\\ndynamically [57]. One of the examples appropriately\\nintegratingdomainknowledgewithaﬀectionisMinecraftEdu. *is is a historical simulation game where studentscanlearnabouthistoricalﬁguresandeventsorgetinsightinto the spread of epidemics. Learners could get access tohistorical events with authenticemotions in the real-timeinteraction, and the collateral emotion would help thembetter understand the speciﬁc content knowledge [8].Complexity 11\\n 8503, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/8812542 by Sri Lanka National Access, Wiley Online Library on [22/11/2024].

According to\\nselected qualitative research (as shown in Table 3), the\\nexplorationofAIineducationexperiencedaprocessfromtheoretical research to a speciﬁc practice ﬁeld, and at lastback to review. Simultaneously, qualitative research also\\nprovided support for the development of quantitative\\nresearch throughout the whole process. Some theoreticalstudies were at the forefront. For example, in 2011 and2012, qualitative research on decentralized theory [43]and swarm intelligence [59] appeared, and then the realartiﬁcial intelligence research began. AI algorithms werenot very mature at the beginning while advanced intel-ligentalgorithmsareusuallybasedonbigdatatechnology,and they could constantly learn and improve in themassive data. *e big data must be decentralized andgroup-oriented. *erefore, we believe that the early the-\\noretical research has played a signiﬁcant supporting role.\\nIn 2019, researchers attached more emphasis on thesummary of previous studies and prospects for futuredevelopment,andmoreconsiderationwillbegiventothestatusquo, future, andpossibleproblems ofAI invarioussectors of education.\\n4.The Research Trends of AI in Education\\n4.1. Technology Adoption of Internet of :ings. *e existing\\nresearch mainly focused on the virtual online system, andthe Internet of *ings (IoT) is less noticed. Learners’ bio-feedback also needs to be explored in future educational\\nresearch.Accordingtothereviewedpapers,amajorityofAI\\ntechnology in education focused on online informationtechnology or system (107 out of 109), such as intelligenttutoring system, intelligent virtual laboratory, and assess-ment system. Only one study [55] employed a wearablecircuit to examine learners’ biofeedback. *is may be at-tributed to the fact that the intelligent online system is wellestablished, easier to build on, and cost-eﬀective. However,to cater to diverse learning contents and varied learningskills,theIoTholdsmuchpromise.Itmayenhancestudents’spatial and mechanical understanding of physical con-\\nstructionprocessesinscienceeducation.*eIoTtechnology\\ncansimulatebrainfunctionsinphysicalcontexttosenseandunderstandhuman’scognitivebehaviours,whichapparentlyoptimizes human cognition and performance in two qual-itativestudies[33,60].Althoughno empiricalstudiesintheselectedpaperswerefoundtotesttheeﬀectofIoTtechniqueon education, the IoT with aﬀordable costs and wearablecomputing devices could be a potential area of future de-velopment of AI in education. *is is consistent with theHorizon report in 2019.4.2.SwarmIntelligenceinEducation.

Moreover, swarm intelligence maychange teachers’ duties from knowledge transmission toknowledgeorganization.Previousresearchhassuggestedthe\\nexploration of crowdfunding or crowdsourcing by teachers\\non education, and how teachers perform their organizingability in the future [5]. However, as Figure 2 presents, theinvestigation from teachers’ perspective is still inadequate,which needs further study. Secondly, swarm intelligencefacilitated adaptivity in dynamic or unstable environments.Swarm agents usually exchange information by leavingmarks and observing the activities of their peers. For ex-ample,thebestsolutioninthecurrentmomentmaybecomeunavailableinthenextmoment.*erefore,itissuggestedtoinvest further how AI performs dynamic recommendation\\nfor students on diﬀerent learning progress [59].\\n4.3.DeepLearningandNeurocomputation. Deeplearningor\\nmachine learning will reshape the interactions between\\nhuman beings and machines in the future. *e trends ofhuman-computerinteractionwillnolongerbebasedontheperspective of machine operation by a human. Instead, themachine can improve predictions by learning from big data\\nwithoutbeingspeciﬁcallyprogrammed.Twostudiesondeep\\nlearning were ﬁrst mentioned in the selected papers in 2017[23,32].In2018,oneempiricalstudy[37]waspublishedandit focused the deep learning technology on the modelling ofscoring-based data. However, the data based on human’sphysical features were less noticed. Based on the basis ofneuroscientiﬁcunderstandingofthebrain,PearsonandIBMhaveproposedtoinvestigateneurocomputationbrain-basededucationaltechnologies[33].However,onlytwoqualitativestudies [33, 60] suggested the integration of neuroscienceand AI in the education sector. Future research trends in\\nintegrating brain function with deep learning techniques to\\noptimizehuman-computerinteractioncouldbeexpected.Itwill inﬂuence the application and integration of AI in ed-ucation, such as adaptive learning and role-play. *is viewhasbeenreportedintheHorizonreportin2018.Speciﬁcally,thereportforecaststhatadaptivelearningtechniqueswillbefurther generalized in two to three years.\\n4.4. Evaluation of AI in Education. All empirical studies\\nreviewed presented the positive eﬀects of AI techniques on\\neducation (see Table 1). However, the interview and thereview paper have, respectively, surfaced the challenges ormisunderstandingofAIineducation[4,21].*ereisaneedto articulate a holistic evaluation criterion to measure theeﬀectiveness of AI in education. To ensure the validity andreliability of the evaluation, a multidimensional modelshould be adopted, which includes technique, pedagogicaldesign, domain knowledge, and human factors. Woolf’s[119] Roadmap for Education Technology predicted that in\\nthe era of AI Educational Data Mining, the lifelong as-\\nsessment of students’ knowledge, their progress, and theenvironments where they learn, as well as the success andfailureinteachingstrategies,canbechronologicallytracked.\\nBesides,currentresearchisdisproportionatelyfocusedon\\nspeciﬁc educational contexts and a handful of variables. Asshown in Figure 2, most research sampled students as par-ticipants, while teachers and professor practitioners were less\\nnoticed; additionally, most researchers considered science,\\nhumanity,andsocialscienceassubjects,butlessattentionwaspaid to sports, arts, and special education. For example, onlyonestudywasfoundtodeveloptext-to-diagramconversionasa novel teaching aid for blind learners [30].\\n5.The Challenges AI Confronted in Education\\nAI is a promising ﬁeld that faces many technology bottle-necks.*echallengeswouldbemorecomplexandintricate,\\nespecially when they are connected to an application in\\neducation. *e challenges this review identiﬁes could beclassiﬁed into three categories: technique, teachers andstudents, and social ethics.\\nAlthough AI techniques displayed and predicted smart\\ncomputation in the education domain, they generally fail tobring “added-value” to large-scale students because of theconcern of costs, and the mainstream is still occupied by“basic value” [38]. Speciﬁcally, some researchers found thatmany AI techniques were designed for a general situationthat could not address the needs of a particular domain,\\nspeciﬁc learning activities, or teaching goals. *is would\\nprevent the actualization of personalized learning experi-ences [8, 120].\\nAnother great challenge reported in the Horizon report\\nin 2018 is the reconceptualization of the role of educators.Teachers’ attitudes towards AI have a signiﬁcant inﬂuenceon the eﬀectiveness of using AI in education. Teachers mayswingfromtotalresistancetooverreliance.*eformercouldarisefrominadequate,inappropriate,irrelevant,oroutdatedprofessionaldevelopment.*elattermaybeduetoteachers’unrealisticexpectations.*eseteachersmayfocustoomuch\\non the emerging AI technologies rather than learning itself\\n[44]. Additionally, from the perspective of students, AItechnique may provide smart and eﬃcient tools that causestudentstoavoiddoingtheknowledgeprocessingworkthatteachers expect them to do. For example, the AI translatorsmay oﬀer ready-made illustrations, pronunciation, ﬁxedphrases, and even a serial of examples. Students are thusunwilling to engage in the inquiry processes that facilitatedeep learning.\\n*e ethical issues brought by AI are also challenging for\\nboth researchers and educational practitioners. It was clear\\nthatAIhasmadegreatstridesoverthepastfewyears,mostly\\nbecause of cheaper processing and the availability of data;however,individualstudentdatamaybeexposed,shared,orused inappropriately. It is a constantly mindful challengethat educators and AI engineers will face when consideringhow we access, evaluate, and share the big data and theresults of data analysis [44, 65]. Another ethical debate wasconspicuously found in gamiﬁcation that emphasis shouldbe put on learning and tend to “suck the fun out” of games,or on gameplay “suck out the learning” [57].Complexity 13\\n 8503, 2021, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/8812542 by Sri Lanka National Access, Wiley Online Library on [22/11/2024].

It is found that the\\nresearch to date could be classiﬁed into three dimensions:\\nthe dimension of development including classiﬁcation,matching, recommendation, and deep learning; the di-mensionofanextractioninvolvingfeedback,reasoning,andadaptive learning; and the dimension of application in-cluding aﬀection computing, role-playing, immersivelearning,andgamiﬁcation.Moreover,basedontheresearchquestionsandtherelatedAItechniques,fourresearchtrendswere identiﬁed. *ey are the Internet of *ings, swarmintelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience, as well as anassessmentoftheeﬀectofAIineducation.*echallengesof\\nAI in education were also conspicuously seen in terms of\\ntechnique perspective, teachers’ and students’ roles, andsocial ethical issues. *ese ﬁndings could be valuable ref-erences for educational researchers, students, and AI de-velopers who plan to contribute to the relevant studies.Furthermore,itseemsclearthateducatorsneedtoworkwithAI engineers to address the gaps between technique andpedagogy.\\n7.Limitations and Future Study\\nAlthoughthisreviewdoesproposesomevaluabletrendsandpotential research directions for AI in education, there existseveral limitations. Firstly, thepapers reviewed in this study\\nwereﬁlteredfromSocialScienceCitationIndex,whileother\\ndatabases on natural science (e.g., SCOPUS and EI) andsources (e.g., reports, news, conference papers, and patents)couldbeinvolvedtooﬀeramorecomprehensiveoverviewinthis ﬁeld. For instance, articles from the International\\nJournal of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Education that has pub-\\nlished30volumeswerenotconsidered.*isreviewthereforeis limited only to SSCI articles. Additionally, the initialsearch could be extended using more keywords such asadaptive learning and tutor system, which may lead to thelatest technical reports of AI in education that were notincluded in this paper. Secondly, since the current reviewwasnotattemptedtobeinclusivebuttoprovideasystematicoverview of AI in education, the analysis in this review mayprovide a framework for future research integration. Forexample, a more formal meta-analysis could be conductedon selected empirical studiesthatreported eﬀect sizesto seewhat impact on learning AI might be having.

Every time a \\nweb search engine li\\nke Google is used to search the internet, one of the reasons that work so well is because a learning algorithm that \\nhas learned how to rank web pages. These algorithms are used for various purposes like data mining, image processing, predict\\nive \\nanalytics, \\netc. to name a few. The main advantage of using machine learning is that, once an algorithm learns what to do with data, it \\ncan do its work automatically. In this paper, a brief review and future prospect of the vast applications of machine learning\\n \\nalgori\\nthms\\n \\nhas been made.\\n \\n \\n \\nKeywords: \\nAlgorithm, Machine Learning, Pseudo Code, Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Reinforcement learning\\n \\n \\n1.\\n \\nIntroduction\\n \\n \\nSince \\ntheir evolution, humans have been using many types \\nof tools to accomplish various tasks in a simpler way. The \\ncreativity of the human brain led to the invention of different \\nmachines. These machines made the human life easy by \\nenabling \\npeople\\n \\nto meet various life needs, including \\ntravelling, industries, and computing. And Machine learning \\nis the one among them.\\n \\n \\nAccording to Arthur Samuel Machine learning is defined as \\nthe field of study that gives computers the ability to learn \\nwithout \\nbeing explicitly programmed. Arthur Samuel was \\nfamous for his checkers playing program. \\nMachine learning \\n(ML)\\n \\nis used to teach machines how to handle the data more \\nefficiently. Sometimes after viewing the data, we cannot \\ninterpret the extract information f\\nrom the data. In that case, \\nwe apply machine learning. With the abundance of datasets \\navailable, the demand for machine learning is in rise. Many \\nindustries apply machine learning to extract relevant data. \\nThe purpose of machine learning is to learn from t\\nhe data. \\nMany studies have been done on how to make machines \\nlearn by themselves without being explicitly programmed. \\nMany mathematicians and programmers apply several \\napproaches to find the solution of this problem which are \\nhaving huge data sets. \\n \\nMachine Learning relies on different algorithms to solve \\ndata problems. Data scientists like to point out that there‟s \\nno single one\\n-\\nsize\\n-\\nfits\\n-\\nall type of algorithm that is best to \\nsolve a \\nproblem. The kind of algorithm employed depends \\non the kind of problem you wish to solve, the number of \\nvariables, the kind of model that would suit it best and so on. \\nHere‟s a quick look at some of the commonly used \\nalgorithms in machine learning (ML)\\n \\n \\nSu\\npervised Learning\\n \\nSupervised learning\\n \\nis the\\n \\nmachine learning\\n \\ntask of learning \\na function that maps an input to an output based on example \\ninput\\n-\\noutput pairs.\\n \\nIt infers a function from\\n \\nlabelled\\n \\ntraining \\ndata\\n \\nconsisting of a set of\\n \\ntraining examples. The su\\npervised \\nmachine learning algorithms are those algorithms which \\nneeds external assistance. The input dataset is divided into \\ntrain and test dataset. The train dataset has output variable \\nwhich needs to be predicted or classified. All algorithms \\nlearn some \\nkind of patterns from the training dataset and \\napply them to the test dataset for prediction or classification. \\nThe workflow of supervised machine learning algorithms is \\ngiven in fig below.

I NTRODUCTION\\nIn digital world, data are generated from various sources\\nand the fast transition from digital technologies has led to\\ngrowth of big data. It provides evolutionary breakthroughs in\\nmany ﬁelds with collection of large datasets. In general, it\\nrefers to the collection of large and complex datasets which\\nare difﬁcult to process using traditional database management\\ntools or data processing applications. These are available\\nin structured, semi-structured, and unstructured format in\\npetabytes and beyond. Formally, it is deﬁned from 3Vs to 4Vs.\\n3Vs refers to volume, velocity, and variety. V olume refers to\\nthe huge amount of data that are being generated everyday\\nwhereas velocity is the rate of growth and how fast the data\\nare gathered for being analysis. Variety provides information\\nabout the types of data such as structured, unstructured, semi-\\nstructured etc. The fourth V refers to veracity that includes\\navailability and accountability. The prime objective of big data\\nanalysis is to process data of high volume, velocity, variety, and\\nveracity using various traditional and computational intelligent\\ntechniques [1]. Some of these extraction methods for obtaining\\nhelpful information was discussed by Gandomi and Haider\\n[2]. The following Figure 1 refers to the deﬁnition of big\\ndata. However exact deﬁnition for big data is not deﬁned and\\nthere is a believe that it is problem speciﬁc. This will help us\\nin obtaining enhanced decision making, insight discovery and\\noptimization while being innovative and cost-effective.\\nIt is expected that the growth of big data is estimated to\\nreach 25 billion by 2015 [3]. From the perspective of the\\ninformation and communication technology, big data is a ro-\\nbust impetus to the next generation of information technologyindustries [4], which are broadly built on the third platform,\\nmainly referring to big data, cloud computing, internet of\\nthings, and social business. Generally, Data warehouses have\\nbeen used to manage the large dataset. In this case extracting\\nthe precise knowledge from the available big data is a foremost\\nissue. Most of the presented approaches in data mining are not\\nusually able to handle the large datasets successfully. The key\\nproblem in the analysis of big data is the lack of coordination\\nbetween database systems as well as with analysis tools such as\\ndata mining and statistical analysis. These challenges generally\\narise when we wish to perform knowledge discovery and repre-\\nsentation for its practical applications. A fundamental problem\\nis how to quantitatively describe the essential characteristics\\nof big data. There is a need for epistemological implications\\nin describing data revolution [5]. Additionally, the study on\\ncomplexity theory of big data will help understand essential\\ncharacteristics and formation of complex patterns in big data,\\nsimplify its representation, gets better knowledge abstraction,\\nand guide the design of computing models and algorithms\\non big data [4]. Much research was carried out by various\\nresearchers on big data and its trends [6], [7], [8].\\nHowever, it is to be noted that all data available in the\\nform of big data are not useful for analysis or decision making\\nprocess. Industry and academia are interested in disseminating\\nthe ﬁndings of big data. This paper focuses on challenges in\\nbig data and its available techniques. Additionally, we state\\nopen research issues in big data. So, to elaborate this, the\\npaper is divided into following sections. Sections 2 deals\\nwith challenges that arise during ﬁne tuning of big data.\\nSection 3 furnishes the open research issues that will help\\nus to process big data and extract useful knowledge from it.\\nSection 4 provides an insight to big data tools and techniques.\\nConclusion remarks are provided in section 5 to summarize\\noutcomes.\\nII. C HALLENGES IN BIGDATA ANALYTICS\\nRecent years big data has been accumulated in several\\ndomains like health care, public administration, retail, bio-\\nchemistry, and other interdisciplinary scientiﬁc researches.\\nWeb-based applications encounter big data frequently, such\\nas social computing, internet text and documents, and inter-\\nnet search indexing. Social computing includes social net-\\nwork analysis, online communities, recommender systems,\\nreputation systems, and prediction markets where as internet\\nsearch indexing includes ISI, IEEE Xplorer, Scopus, Thomson(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applicati ons, \\nVol. 7, No. 2, 2016 \\n511 | P a g e\\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org Fig. 1: Characteristics of Big Data\\nReuters etc. Considering this advantages of big data it provides\\na new opportunities in the knowledge processing tasks for\\nthe upcoming researchers. However oppotunities always follow\\nsome challenges.\\nTo handle the challenges we need to know various compu-\\ntational complexities, information security, and computational\\nmethod, to analyze big data. For example, many statistical\\nmethods that perform well for small data size do not scale\\nto voluminous data. Similarly, many computational techniques\\nthat perform well for small data face signiﬁcant challenges in\\nanalyzing big data. Various challenges that the health sector\\nface was being researched by much researchers [9], [10]. Here\\nthe challenges of big data analytics are classiﬁed into four\\nbroad categories namely data storage and analysis; knowledge\\ndiscovery and computational complexities; scalability and vi-\\nsualization of data; and information security. We discuss these\\nissues brieﬂy in the following subsections.\\nA. Data Storage and Analysis\\nIn recent years the size of data has grown exponentially\\nby various means such as mobile devices, aerial sensory\\ntechnologies, remote sensing, radio frequency identiﬁcation\\nreaders etc. These data are stored on spending much cost\\nwhereas they ignored or deleted ﬁnally becuase there is no\\nenough space to store them. Therefore, the ﬁrst challenge for\\nbig data analysis is storage mediums and higher input/output\\nspeed. In such cases, the data accessibility must be on the\\ntop priority for the knowledge discovery and representation.\\nThe prime reason is being that, it must be accessed easily and\\npromptly for further analysis. In past decades, analyst use hard\\ndisk drives to store data but, it slower random input/output\\nperformance than sequential input/output. To overcome this\\nlimitation, the concept of solid state drive (SSD) and phrase\\nchange memory (PCM) was introduced. However the avialable\\nstorage technologies cannot possess the required performance\\nfor processing big data.\\nAnother challenge with Big Data analysis is attributed\\nto diversity of data. with the ever growing of datasets, data\\nmining tasks has signiﬁcantly increased. Additionally data\\nreduction, data selection, feature selection is an essential task\\nespecially when dealing with large datasets. This presents anunprecedented challenge for researchers. It is becuase, existing\\nalgorithms may not always respond in an adequate time when\\ndealing with these high dimensional data. Automation of this\\nprocess and developing new machine learning algorithms to\\nensure consistency is a major challenge in recent years. In\\naddition to all these Clustering of large datasets that help\\nin analyzing the big data is of prime concern [11]. Recent\\ntechnologies such as hadoop and mapReduce make it possible\\nto collect large amount of semi structured and unstructured\\ndata in a reasonable amount of time. The key engineering\\nchallenge is how to effectively analyze these data for obtaining\\nbetter knowledge. A standard process to this end is to transform\\nthe semi structured or unstructured data into structured data,\\nand then apply data mining algorithms to extract knowledge. A\\nframework to analyze data was discussed by Das and Kumar\\n[12]. Similarly detail explanation of data analysis for public\\ntweets was also discussed by Das et al in their paper [13].\\nThe major challenge in this case is to pay more attention for\\ndesigning storage sytems and to elevate efﬁcient data analysis\\ntool that provide guarantees on the output when the data\\ncomes from different sources. Furthermore, design of machine\\nlearning algorithms to analyze data is essential for improving\\nefﬁciency and scalability.\\nB. Knowledge Discovery and Computational Complexities\\nKnowledge discovery and representation is a prime issue\\nin big data. It includes a number of sub ﬁelds such as\\nauthentication, archiving, management, preservation, informa-\\ntion retrieval, and representation. There are several tools for\\nknowledge discovery and representation such as fuzzy set\\n[14], rough set [15], soft set [16], near set [17], formal\\nconcept analysis [18], principal component analysis [19] etc to\\nname a few. Additionally many hybridized techniques are also\\ndeveloped to process real life problems. All these techniques\\nare problem dependent. Further some of these techniques may\\nnot be suitable for large datasets in a sequential computer. At\\nthe same time some of the techniques has good characteristics\\nof scalability over parallel computer. Since the size of big\\ndata keeps increasing exponentially, the available tools may\\nnot be efﬁcient to process these data for obtaining meaningful\\ninformation. The most popular approach in case of larage\\ndataset management is data warehouses and data marts. Data\\nwarehouse is mainly responsible to store data that are sourced\\nfrom operational systems whereas data mart is based on a data\\nwarehouse and facilitates analysis.\\nAnalysis of large dataset requires more computational\\ncomplexities. The major issue is to handle inconsistencies\\nand uncertainty present in the datasets. In general, systematic\\nmodeling of the computational complexity is used. It may be\\ndifﬁcult to establish a comprehensive mathematical system that\\nis broadly applicable to Big Data. But a domain speciﬁc data\\nanalytics can be done easily by understanding the particular\\ncomplexities. A series of such development could simulate big\\ndata analytics for different areas. Much research and survey\\nhas been carried out in this direction using machine learning\\ntechniques with the least memory requirements. The basic\\nobjective in these research is to minimize computational cost\\nprocessing and complexities [20], [21], [22].\\nHowever, current big data analysis tools have poor per-\\nformance in handling computational complexities, uncertainty,(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applicati ons, \\nVol. 7, No. 2, 2016 \\n512 | P a g e\\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org and inconsistencies. It leads to a great challenge to develop\\ntechniques and technologies that can deal computational com-\\nplexity, uncertainty,and inconsistencies in a effective manner.\\nC. Scalability and Visualization of Data\\nThe most important challenge for big data analysis tech-\\nniques is its scalability and security. In the last decades\\nresearchers have paid attentions to accelerate data analysis and\\nits speed up processors followed by Moore’s Law. For the\\nformer, it is necessary to develop sampling, on-line, and mul-\\ntiresolution analysis techniques. Incremental techniques have\\ngood scalability property in the aspect of big data analysis. As\\nthe data size is scaling much faster than CPU speeds, there is a\\nnatural dramatic shift in processor technology being embedded\\nwith increasing number of cores [23]. This shift in processors\\nleads to the development of parallel computing. Real time\\napplications like navigation, social networks, ﬁnance, internet\\nsearch, timeliness etc. requires parallel computing.\\nThe objective of visualizing data is to present them more\\nadequately using some techniques of graph theory. Graphical\\nvisualization provides the link between data with proper inter-\\npretation. However, online marketplace like ﬂipkart, amazon,\\ne-bay have millions of users and billions of goods to sold each\\nmonth. This generates a lot of data. To this end, some company\\nuses a tool Tableau for big data visualization. It has capability\\nto transform large and complex data into intuitive pictures. This\\nhelp employees of a company to visualize search relevance,\\nmonitor latest customer feeback, and their sentiment analysis.\\nHowever, current big data visualization tools mostly have poor\\nperformances in functionalities, scalability, and response in\\ntime.\\nWe can observe that big data have produced many chal-\\nlenges for the developments of the hardware and software\\nwhich leads to parallel computing, cloud computing, dis-\\ntributed computing, visualization process, scalability. To over-\\ncome this issue, we need to correlate more mathematical\\nmodels to computer science.\\nD. Information Security\\nIn big data analysis massive amount of data are correlated,\\nanalyzed, and mined for meaningful patterns. All organizations\\nhave different policies to safe guard their sensitive information.\\nPreserving sensitive information is a major issue in big data\\nanalysis. There is a huge security risk associated with big data\\n[24]. Therefore, information security is becoming a big data\\nanalytics problem. Security of big data can be enhanced by\\nusing the techniques of authentication, authorization, and en-\\ncryption. Various security measures that big data applications\\nface are scale of network, variety of different devices, real time\\nsecurity monitoring, and lack of intrusion system [25], [26].\\nThe security challenge caused by big data has attracted the\\nattention of information security. Therefore, attention has to\\nbe given to develop a multi level security policy model and\\nprevention system.\\nAlthough much research has been carried out to secure\\nbig data [25] but it requires lot of improvement. The major\\nchallenge is to develop a multi-level security, privacy preserved\\ndata model for big data.III. O PEN RESEARCH ISSUES IN BIGDATA ANALYTICS\\nBig data analytics and data science are becoming the\\nresearch focal point in industries and academia. Data science\\naims at researching big data and knowledge extraction from\\ndata. Applications of big data and data science include infor-\\nmation science, uncertainty modeling, uncertain data analysis,\\nmachine learning, statistical learning, pattern recognition, data\\nwarehousing, and signal processing. Effective integration of\\ntechnologies and analysis will result in predicting the future\\ndrift of events. Main focus of this section is to discuss open\\nresearch issues in big data analytics. The research issues\\npertaining to big data analysis are classiﬁed into three broad\\ncategories namely internet of things (IoT), cloud computing,\\nbio inspired computing, and quantum computing. However it\\nis not limited to these issues. More research issues related to\\nhealth care big data can be found in Husing Kuo et al. paper\\n[9].\\nA. IoT for Big Data Analytics\\nInternet has restructured global interrelations, the art of\\nbusinesses, cultural revolutions and an unbelievable number\\nof personal characteristics. Currently, machines are getting in\\non the act to control innumerable autonomous gadgets via\\ninternet and create Internet of Things (IoT). Thus, appliances\\nare becoming the user of the internet, just like humans with\\nthe web browsers. Internet of Things is attracting the attention\\nof recent researchers for its most promising opportunities\\nand challenges. It has an imperative economic and societal\\nimpact for the future construction of information, network and\\ncommunication technology. The new regulation of future will\\nbe eventually, everything will be connected and intelligently\\ncontrolled. The concept of IoT is becoming more pertinent\\nto the realistic world due to the development of mobile de-\\nvices, embedded and ubiquitous communication technologies,\\ncloud computing, and data analytics. Moreover, IoT presents\\nchallenges in combinations of volume, velocity and variety.\\nIn a broader sense, just like the internet, Internet of Things\\nenables the devices to exist in a myriad of places and facilitates\\napplications ranging from trivial to the crucial. Conversely, it is\\nstill mystifying to understand IoT well, including deﬁnitions,\\ncontent and differences from other similar concepts. Several\\ndiversiﬁed technologies such as computational intelligence,\\nand big-data can be incorporated together to improve the\\ndata management and knowledge discovery of large scale\\nautomation applications. Much research in this direction has\\nbeen carried out by Mishra, Lin and Chang [27].\\nKnowledge acquisition from IoT data is the biggest chal-\\nlenge that big data professional are facing. Therefore, it is\\nessential to develop infrastructure to analyze the IoT data. An\\nIoT device generates continuous streams of data and the re-\\nsearchers can develop tools to extract meaningful information\\nfrom these data using machine learning techniques. Under-\\nstanding these streams of data generated from IoT devices and\\nanalysing them to get meaningful information is a challenging\\nissue and it leads to big data analytics. Machine learning\\nalgorithms and computational intelligence techniques is the\\nonly solution to handle big data from IoT prospective. Key\\ntechnologies that are associated with IoT are also discussed in\\nmany research papers [28]. Figure 2 depicts an overview of\\nIoT big data and knowledge discovery process.(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applicati ons, \\nVol. 7, No. 2, 2016 \\n513 | P a g e\\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org Fig. 2: IoT Big Data Knowledge Discovery\\nKnowledge exploration system have originated from theo-\\nries of human information processing such as frames, rules,\\ntagging, and semantic networks. In general, it consists of\\nfour segments such as knowledge acquisition, knowledge\\nbase, knowledge dissemination, and knowledge application.\\nIn knowledge acquisition phase, knowledge is discovered\\nby using various traditional and computational intelligence\\ntechniques. The discovered knowledge is stored in knowledge\\nbases and expert systems are generally designed based on the\\ndiscovered knowledge. Knowledge dissemination is important\\nfor obtaining meaningful information from the knowledge\\nbase. Knowledge extraction is a process that searches doc-\\numents, knowledge within documents as well as knowledge\\nbases. The ﬁnal phase is to apply discovered knowledge in\\nvarious applications. It is the ultimate goal of knowledge\\ndiscovery. The knowledge exploration system is necessarily\\niterative with the judgement of knowledge application. There\\nare many issues, discussions, and researches in this area of\\nknowledge exploration. It is beyond scope of this survey\\npaper. For better visualization, knowledge exploration system\\nis depicted in Figure 3.\\nFig. 3: IoT Knowledge Exploration System\\nB. Cloud Computing for Big Data Analytics\\nThe development of virtualization technologies have made\\nsupercomputing more accessible and affordable. Computinginfrastructures that are hidden in virtualization software make\\nsystems to behave like a true computer, but with the ﬂexibility\\nof speciﬁcation details such as number of processors, disk\\nspace, memory, and operating system. The use of these virtual\\ncomputers is known as cloud computing which has been one\\nof the most robust big data technique. Big Data and cloud\\ncomputing technologies are developed with the importance of\\ndeveloping a scalable and on demand availability of resources\\nand data. Cloud computing harmonize massive data by on-\\ndemand access to conﬁgurable computing resources through\\nvirtualization techniques. The beneﬁts of utilizing the Cloud\\ncomputing include offering resources when there is a demand\\nand pay only for the resources which is needed to develop\\nthe product. Simultaneously, it improves availability and cost\\nreduction. Open challenges and research issues of big data\\nand cloud computing are discussed in detail by many re-\\nsearchers which highlights the challenges in data management,\\ndata variety and velocity, data storage, data processing, and\\nresource management [29], [30]. So Cloud computing helps\\nin developing a business model for all varieties of applications\\nwith infrastructure and tools.\\nBig data application using cloud computing should support\\ndata analytic and development. The cloud environment should\\nprovide tools that allow data scientists and business analysts to\\ninteractively and collaboratively explore knowledge acquisition\\ndata for further processing and extracting fruitful results.\\nThis can help to solve large applications that may arise in\\nvarious domains. In addition to this, cloud computing should\\nalso enable scaling of tools from virtual technologies into\\nnew technologies like spark, R, and other types of big data\\nprocessing techniques.\\nBig data forms a framework for discussing cloud comput-\\ning options. Depending on special need, user can go to the\\nmarketplace and buy infrastructure services from cloud service\\nproviders such as Google, Amazon, IBM, software as a service\\n(SaaS) from a whole crew of companies such as NetSuite,\\nCloud9, Jobscience etc. Another advantage of cloud computing\\nis cloud storage which provides a possible way for storing big\\ndata. The obvious one is the time and cost that are needed to\\nupload and download big data in the cloud environment. Else,\\nit becomes difﬁcult to control the distribution of computation\\nand the underlying hardware. But, the major issues are privacy\\nconcerns relating to the hosting of data on public servers,\\nand the storage of data from human studies. All these issues\\nwill take big data and cloud computing to a high level of\\ndevelopment.\\nC. Bio-inspired Computing for Big Data Analytics\\nBio-inspired computing is a technique inspired ny nature\\nto address complex real world problems. Biological systems\\nare self organized without a central control. A bio-inspired\\ncost minimization mechanism search and ﬁnd the optimal\\ndata service solution on considering cost of data management\\nand service maintenance. These techniques are developed by\\nbiological molecules such as DNA and proteins to conduct\\ncomputational calculations involving storing, retrieving, and\\nprocessing of data. A signiﬁcant feature of such computing\\nis that it integrates biologically derived materials to perform\\ncomputational functions and receive intelligent performance.\\nThese systems are more suitable for big data applications.(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applicati ons, \\nVol. 7, No. 2, 2016 \\n514 | P a g e\\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org Huge amount of data are generated from variety of resources\\nacross the web since the digitization. Analyzing these data\\nand categorizing into text, image and video etc will require\\nlot of intelligent analytics from data scientists and big data\\nprofessionals. Proliferations of technologies are emerging like\\nbig data, IoT, cloud computing, bio inspired computing etc\\nwhereas equilibrium of data can be done only by selecting right\\nplatform to analyze large and furnish cost effective results.\\nBio-inspired computing techniques serve as a key role in\\nintelligent data analysis and its application to big data. These\\nalgorithms help in performing data mining for large datasets\\ndue to its optimization application. The most advantage is its\\nsimplicity and their rapid concergence to optimal solution [31]\\nwhile solving service provision problems. Some applications to\\nthis end using bio inspired computing was discussed in detail\\nby Cheng et al [32]. From the discussions, we can observe that\\nthe bio-inspired computing models provide smarter interac-\\ntions, inevitable data losses, and help is handling ambiguities.\\nHence, it is believed that in future bio-inspired computing may\\nhelp in handling big data to a large extent.\\nD. Quantum Computing for Big Data Analysis\\nA quantum computer has memory that is exponentially\\nlarger than its physical size and can manipulate an exponential\\nset of inputs simultaneously [33]. This exponential improve-\\nment in computer systems might be possible. If a real quantum\\ncomputer is available now, it could have solved problems\\nthat are exceptionally difﬁcult on recent computers, of course\\ntoday’s big data problems. The main technical difﬁculty in\\nbuilding quantum computer could soon be possible. Quantum\\ncomputing provides a way to merge the quantum mechanics to\\nprocess the information. In traditional computer, information\\nis presented by long strings of bits which encode either a\\nzero or a one. On the other hand a quantum computer uses\\nquantum bits or qubits. The difference between qubit and bit\\nis that, a qubit is a quantum system that encodes the zero and\\nthe one into two distinguishable quantum states. Therefore,\\nit can be capitalized on the phenomena of superposition and\\nentanglement. It is because qubits behave quantumly. For\\nexample, 100 qubits in quantum systems require 2100 complex\\nvalues to be stored in a classic computer system. It means that\\nmany big data problems can be solved much faster by larger\\nscale quantum computers compared with classical computers.\\nHence it is a challenge for this generation to built a quantum\\ncomputer and facilitate quantum computing to solve big data\\nproblems.\\nIV. T OOLS FOR BIG DATA PROCESSING\\nLarge numbers of tools are available to process big data. In\\nthis section, we discuss some current techniques for analyzing\\nbig data with emphasis on three important emerging tools\\nnamely MapReduce, Apache Spark, and Storm. Most of the\\navailable tools concentrate on batch processing, stream pro-\\ncessing,and interactive analysis. Most batch processing tools\\nare based on the Apache Hadoop infrastructure such as Mahout\\nand Dryad. Stream data applications are mostly used for real\\ntime analytic. Some examples of large scale streaming platform\\nare Strom and Splunk. The interactive analysis process allow\\nusers to directly interact in real time for their own analysis.For example Dremel and Apache Drill are the big data plat-\\nforms that support interactive analysis. These tools help us in\\ndeveloping the big data projects. A fabulous list of big data\\ntools and techniques is also discussed by much researchers [6],\\n[34]. The typical work ﬂow of big data project discussed by\\nHuang et al is highlighted in this section [35] and is depicted\\nin Figure 4.\\nFig. 4: Workﬂow of Big Data Project\\nA. Apache Hadoop and MapReduce\\nThe most established software platform for big data anal-\\nysis is Apache Hadoop and Mapreduce. It consists of hadoop\\nkernel, mapreduce, hadoop distributed ﬁle system (HDFS)\\nand apache hive etc. Map reduce is a programming model\\nfor processing large datasets is based on divide and conquer\\nmethod. The divide and conquer method is implemented in two\\nsteps such as Map step and Reduce Step. Hadoop works on\\ntwo kinds of nodes such as master node and worker node. The\\nmaster node divides the input into smaller sub problems and\\nthen distributes them to worker nodes in map step. Thereafter\\nthe master node combines the outputs for all the subproblems\\nin reduce step. Moreover, Hadoop and MapReduce works as\\na powerful software framework for solving big data problems.\\nIt is also helpful in fault-tolerant storage and high throughput\\ndata processing.\\nB. Apache Mahout\\nApache mahout aims to provide scalable and commercial\\nmachine learning techniques for large scale and intelligent data\\nanalysis applications. Core algorithms of mahout including\\nclustering, classiﬁcation, pattern mining, regression, dimen-\\nsionalty reduction, evolutionary algorithms, and batch based\\ncollaborative ﬁltering run on top of Hadoop platform through\\nmap reduce framework. The goal of mahout is to build a\\nvibrant, responsive, diverse community to facilitate discussions\\non the project and potential use cases. The basic objective\\nof Apache mahout is to provide a tool for elleviating big\\nchallenges. The different companies those who have imple-\\nmented scalable machine learning algorithms are Google, IBM,\\nAmazon, Yahoo, Twitter, and facebook [36].\\nC. Apache Spark\\nApache spark is an open source big data processing frame-\\nwork built for speed processing, and sophisticated analytics.(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applicati ons, \\nVol. 7, No. 2, 2016 \\n515 | P a g e\\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org It is easy to use and was originally developed in 2009 in UC\\nBerkeleys AMPLab. It was open sourced in 2010 as an Apache\\nproject. Spark lets you quickly write applications in java, scala,\\nor python. In addition to map reduce operations, it supports\\nSQL queries, streaming data, machine learning, and graph data\\nprocessing. Spark runs on top of existing hadoop distributed\\nﬁle system (HDFS) infrastructure to provide enhanced and\\nadditional functionality. Spark consists of components namely\\ndriver program, cluster manager and worker nodes. The driver\\nprogram serves as the starting point of execution of an appli-\\ncation on the spark cluster. The cluster manager allocates the\\nresources and the worker nodes to do the data processing in\\nthe form of tasks. Each application will have a set of processes\\ncalled executors that are responsible for executing the tasks.\\nThe major advantage is that it provides support for deploying\\nspark applications in an existing hadoop clusters. Figure 5\\ndepicts the architecture diagram of Apache Spark. The various\\nfeatures of Apache Spark are listed below:\\nFig. 5: Architecture of Apache Spark\\n• The prime focus of spark includes resilient distributed\\ndatasets (RDD), which store data in-memory and\\nprovide fault tolerance without replication. It supports\\niterative computation, improves speed and resource\\nutilization.\\n• The foremost advantage is that in addition to MapRe-\\nduce, it also supports streaming data, machine learn-\\ning, and graph algorithms.\\n• Another advantage is that, a user can run the applica-\\ntion program in different languages such as Java, R,\\nPython, or Scala. This is possible as it comes with\\nhigher-level libraries for advanced analytics. These\\nstandard libraries increase developer productivity and\\ncan be seamlessly combined to create complex work-\\nﬂows.\\n• Spark helps to run an application in Hadoop cluster,\\nup to 100 times faster in memory, and 10 times faster\\nwhen running on disk. It is possible because of the\\nreduction in number of read or write operations to\\ndisk.\\n• It is written in scala programming language and runs\\non java virtual machine (JVM) environment. Addi-\\ntionally, it upports java, python and R for developing\\napplications using Spark.D. Dryad\\nIt is another popular programming model for implementing\\nparallel and distributed programs for handling large context\\nbases on dataﬂow graph. It consists of a cluster of computing\\nnodes, and an user use the resources of a computer cluster\\nto run their program in a distributed way. Indeed, a dryad\\nuser use thousands of machines, each of them with multiple\\nprocessors or cores. The major advantage is that users do\\nnot need to know anything about concurrent programming. A\\ndryad application runs a computational directed graph that is\\ncomposed of computational vertices and communication chan-\\nnels. Therefore, dryad provides a large number of functionality\\nincluding generating of job graph, scheduling of the machines\\nfor the available processes, transition failure handling in the\\ncluster, collection of performance metrics, visualizing the job,\\ninvokinguser deﬁned policies and dynamically updating the job\\ngraph in response to these policy decisions without knowing\\nthe semantics of the vertices [37].\\nE. Storm\\nStorm is a distributed and fault tolerant real time com-\\nputation system for processing large streaming data. It is\\nspecially designed for real time processing in contrasts with\\nhadoop which is for batch processing. Additionally, it is also\\neasy to set up and operate, scalable, fault-tolerant to provide\\ncompetitive performances. The storm cluster is apparently\\nsimilar to hadoop cluster. On storm cluster users run different\\ntopologies for different storm tasks whereas hadoop platform\\nimplements map reduce jobs for corresponding applications.\\nThere are number of differences between map reduce jobs\\nand topologies. The basic difference is that map reduce job\\neventually ﬁnishes whereas a topology processes messages all\\nthe time, or until user terminate it. A storm cluster consists of\\ntwo kinds of nodes such as master node and worker node. The\\nmaster node and worker node implement two kinds of roles\\nsuch as nimbus and supervisor respectively. The two roles have\\nsimilar functions in accordance with jobtracker and tasktracker\\nof map reduce framework. Nimbus is in charge of distributing\\ncode across the storm cluster, scheduling and assigning tasks\\nto worker nodes, and monitoring the whole system. The\\nsupervisor complies tasks as assigned to them by nimbus.\\nIn addition, it start and terminate the process as necessary\\nbased on the instructions of nimbus. The whole computational\\ntechnology is partitioned and distributed to a number of worker\\nprocesses and each worker process implements a part of the\\ntopology.\\nF . Apache Drill\\nApache drill is another distributed system for interactive\\nanalysis of big data. It has more ﬂexibility to support many\\ntypes of query languages, data formats, and data sources. It is\\nalso specially designed to exploit nested data. Also it has an\\nobjective to scale up on 10,000 servers or more and reaches the\\ncapability to process patabytes of data and trillions of records\\nin seconds. Drill use HDFS for storage and map reduce to\\nperform batch analysis.\\nG. Jaspersoft\\nThe Jaspersoft package is an open source software that\\nproduce reports from database columns. It is a scalable big(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applicati ons, \\nVol. 7, No. 2, 2016 \\n516 | P a g e\\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org data analytical platform and has a capability of fast data visu-\\nalization on popular storage platforms, including MangoDB,\\nCassandra, Redis etc. One important property of Jaspersoft\\nis that it can quickly explore big data without extraction,\\ntransformation, and loading (ETL). In addition to this, it also\\nhave an ability to build powerful hypertext markup language\\n(HTML) reports and dashboards interactively and directly from\\nbig data store without ETL requirement. These generated\\nreports can be shared with anyone inside or outside user’s\\norganization.\\nH. Splunk\\nIn recent years a lot of data are generated through machine\\nfrom business industries. Splunk is a real-time and intelligent\\nplatform developed for exploiting machine generated big data.\\nIt combines the up-to-the-moment cloud technologies and big\\ndata. In turn it helps user to search, monitor, and analyze their\\nmachine generated data through web interface. The results are\\nexhibited in an intuitive way such as graphs, reports, and alerts.\\nSplunk is different from other stream processing tools. Its\\npeculiarities include indexing structured, unstructured machine\\ngenerated data, real-time searching, reporting analytical results,\\nand dashboards. The most important objective of Splunk is\\nto provide metrices for many application, diagnose problems\\nfor system and information technology infrastructures, and\\nintelligent support for business operations.\\nV. S UGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK\\nThe amount of data collected from various applications\\nall over the world across a wide variety of ﬁelds today is\\nexpected to double every two years. It has no utility unless\\nthese are analyzed to get useful information. This necessitates\\nthe development of techniques which can be used to facilitate\\nbig data analysis. The development of powerful computers is\\na boon to implement these techniques leading to automated\\nsystems. The transformation of data into knowledge is by\\nno means an easy task for high performance large-scale data\\nprocessing, including exploiting parallelism of current and\\nupcoming computer architectures for data mining. Moreover,\\nthese data may involve uncertainty in many different forms.\\nMany different models like fuzzy sets, rough sets, soft sets,\\nneural networks, their generalizations and hybrid models ob-\\ntained by combining two or more of these models have been\\nfound to be fruitful in representing data. These models are\\nalso very much fruitful for analysis. More often than not, big\\ndata are reduced to include only the important characteristics\\nnecessary from a particular study point of view or depending\\nupon the application area. So, reduction techniques have been\\ndeveloped. Often the data collected have missing values. These\\nvalues need to be generated or the tuples having these missing\\nvalues are eliminated from the data set before analysis. More\\nimportantly, these new challenges may comprise, sometimes\\neven deteriorate, the performance, efﬁciency and scalability\\nof the dedicated data intensive computing systems. The later\\napproach sometimes leads to loss of information and hence\\nnot preferred. This brings up many research issues in the\\nindustry and research community in forms of capturing and\\naccessing data effectively. In addition, fast processing while\\nachieving high performance and high throughput, and storing\\nit efﬁciently for future use is another issue. Further, pro-\\ngramming for big data analysis is an important challengingissue. Expressing data access requirements of applications\\nand designing programming language abstractions to exploit\\nparallelism are an immediate need [38].\\nAdditionally, machine learning concepts and tools are\\ngaining popularity among researchers to facilitate meaningful\\nresults from these concepts. Research in the area of machine\\nlearning for big data has focused on data processing, algo-\\nrithm implementation, and optimization. Many of the machine\\nlearning tools for big data are started recently needs drastic\\nchange to adopt it. We argue that while each of the tools has\\ntheir advantages and limitations, more efﬁcient tools can be\\ndeveloped for dealing with problems inherent to big data. The\\nefﬁcient tools to be developed must have provision to handle\\nnoisy and imbalance data, uncertainty and inconsistency, and\\nmissing values.\\nVI. C ONCLUSION\\nIn recent years data are generated at a dramatic pace.\\nAnalyzing these data is challenging for a general man. To\\nthis end in this paper, we survey the various research issues,\\nchallenges, and tools used to analyze these big data. From\\nthis survey, it is understood that every big data platform has\\nits individual focus. Some of them are designed for batch\\nprocessing whereas some are good at real-time analytic. Each\\nbig data platform also has speciﬁc functionality. Different\\ntechniques used for the analysis include statistical analysis,\\nmachine learning, data mining, intelligent analysis, cloud com-\\nputing, quantum computing, and data stream processing. We\\nbelive that in future researchers will pay more attention to\\nthese techniques to solve problems of big data effectively and\\nefﬁciently.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] M. K.Kakhani, S. Kakhani and S.

Data mining , the science of extracting\\nuseful knowledge from such huge data repositories, has emer ged as a young and interdisciplinary ﬁeld in\\ncomputer science. Data mining techniques have been widely a pplied to problems in industry, science, en-\\ngineering and government, and it is widely believed that dat a mining will have profound impact on our\\nsociety. The growing consensus that data mining can bring re al value has led to an explosion in demand\\nfor novel data mining technologies and for students who are t rained in data mining—students who have an\\nunderstanding of data mining techniques, can apply them to r eal-life problems, and are trained for research\\nand development of new data mining methods. Courses in data m ining have started to sprawl all over the\\nworld.\\nBased on this development of the ﬁeld, the ACM SIGKDD Executi ve Committee has set up the ACM\\nSIGKDD Curriculum Committee to design a sample curriculum f or data mining that gives recommendations\\nfor educating the next generation of students in data mining . Based on feedback from researchers, educators,\\nand students, we are convinced that it is an important task to have a carefully designed, conceptually strong,\\ntechnically rich, and balanced curriculum for this discipl ine. A comprehensive and balanced curriculum will\\nensure that the education in data mining sets a solid foundat ion for the healthy growth of the ﬁeld, and it will\\npromote systematic training of students in computer scienc e, information sciences, and other related ﬁelds,\\nand it will provide guidance for the training of the next gene ration of data mining researchers, developers\\nand technology users.\\nThe Curriculum Committee is composed of university profess ors and researchers who have actively con-\\ntributed to data mining research and education, researcher s and practitioners from industry who have rich\\nexperiences in applying data mining technology, and admini strators from government agencies. This report\\nis the ﬁrst draft from the Intensive Working Group of the Comm ittee. We expect that this draft will be\\nextensively revised and reviewed, and we are looking forwar d to suggestions and recommendations from the\\nCommittee and from the general data mining research, develo pment, and application community.\\nThe remainder of this report is structured as follows. First , we outline the principles that guided us in\\nthe selection of material in Section 2. We then give a brief de scription of the prerequisites that we assume\\nstudents of our proposed curriculum to have in Section 3. Sec tion 4 contains the core of this document, our\\ncurriculum proposal.\\n2 Curriculum Design Philosophy\\nData mining is an interdisciplinary ﬁeld at the intersectio n of artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, statis-\\ntics, and database systems, and we believe that diﬀerent edu cators will emphasize diﬀerent topics in their\\n1courses. Thus we divided this curriculum proposal into two p arts. The ﬁrst part titled Foundations contains\\nbasic material that we believe should be covered in any intro ductory course on data mining. The second\\npart called Advanced Topics is a comprehensive collection of material that can be sample d to complete an\\nintroductory course or selections of which can form the basi s for an advanced course in data mining.\\nWe believe that the teaching of data mining should concentra te onlong-lasting scientiﬁc principles and\\nconcepts of the ﬁeld. Thus instead of covering the last details of the m ost recent research, we designed the\\nbasic material to lay a solid foundation that opens the door t o explore more advanced material.\\nThe core endeavor in data mining is to extract knowledge from data; this knowledge is captured in a\\nhuman-understandable structure . The discovery of structure in data is a multifaceted proble m that includes\\nthe following components:\\nDatabase and Data Management Issues: Where does the data reside? How is it to be accessed? What\\nforms of sampling are needed? are possible? are appropriate ? What are the implications of the\\ndatabase or data warehouse structure and constraints on dat a movement and data preparation?\\nData Preprocessing: What are the required data transformations before a chosen a lgorithm or class of\\nalgorithms can be applied to the data?

Executive Summary\\nA group of researchers met in Chicago in July, 1997 and in La Jolla in March, 1997 and February, 1998\\nto discuss the current state of the art of data mining and data intensive computing and the opportunities\\nand challenges for the future. The focus of the discussions was on mining large, massive, and distributed\\ndata sets. Here are the main conclusions of the workshops:\\nThe field of data mining and knowledge discovery is emerging as a new, fundamental research\\narea with important applications to science, engineering, medicine, business, and education. Data\\nmining attempts to formulate, analyze and implement basic induction processes that facilitate the\\nextraction of meaningful information and knowledge from unstructured data. Data mining extracts\\npatterns, changes, associations and anomalies from large data sets. Work in data mining ranges\\nfrom theoretical work on the principles of learning and mathematical representations of data to\\nbuilding advanced engineering systems that perform information filtering on the web, find genes\\nin DNA sequences, help understand trends and anomalies in economics and education, and detect\\nnetwork intrusion. Data mining is also a promising computational paradigm that enhances\\ntraditional approaches to discovery and increases the opportunities for breakthroughs in the\\nunderstanding of complex physical and biological systems. Researchers from many intellectual\\ncommunities have much to contribute to this field. These include the communities of machine\\nlearning, statistics, databases, visualization and graphics, optimization, computational\\nmathematics, and the theory of algorithms. \\nThe amount of digital data has been exploding during the past decade, while the number of\\nscientists, engineers, and analysts available to analyze the data has been static. To bridge this gap\\nrequires the solution of fundamentally new research problems, which can be grouped into the\\nfollowing broad challenges: A) developing algorithms and systems to mine large, massive and\\nhigh dimensional data sets; B) developing algorithms and systems to mine new types of data; C)\\ndeveloping algorithms, protocols, and other infrastructure to mine distributed data; and D)\\nimproving the ease of use of data mining systems; E) developing appropriate privacy and securitymodels for data mining.\\nThere is an important need for support by government and business of basic, applied,\\nmultidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research in data mining and knowledge discovery in order\\nto respond to these challenges. \\nThere is an important experimental component to data mining and knowledge discovery which\\nrequires the creation and maintenance of appropriate systems, computational infrastructures and\\ntest beds.\\n2. What is Data Mining?\\nData mining is the semi-automatic discovery of patterns, associations, changes, anomalies, rules, and\\nstatistically significant structures and events in data. That is, data mining attempts to extract knowledge\\nfrom data. \\nData mining differs from traditional statistics in several ways: formal statistical inference is assumption\\ndriven in the sense that a hypothesis is formed and validated against the data. Data mining in contrast is\\ndiscovery driven in the sense that patterns and hypothesis are automatically extracted from data. Said\\nanother way, data mining is data driven, while statistics is human driven. The branch of statistics that\\ndata mining resembles most is exploratory data analysis, although this field, like most of the rest of\\nstatistics, has been focused on data sets far smaller than most that are the target of data mining\\nresearchers.\\nData mining also differs from traditional statistics in that sometimes the goal is to extract qualitative\\nmodels which can easily be translated into logical rules or visual representations; in this sense data\\nmining is human centered and is sometimes coupled with human-computer interfaces research. \\nData mining is a step in the data mining process, which is an interactive, semi-automated process which\\nbegins with raw data. Results of the data mining process may be insights, rules, or predictive models.\\nThe field of data mining draws upon several roots, including statistics, machine learning, databases, and\\nhigh performance computing.\\nIn this report, we are primarily concerned with large data sets, massive data sets, and distributed data\\nsets. By large, we mean data sets which are too large to fit into the memory of a single workstation. By\\nmassive, we mean data sets which are too large to fit onto the disks of a single workstation or a small\\ncluster of workstations. Instead, massive clusters or tertiary storage such as tape are required. By\\ndistributed, we mean data sets which are geographically distributed.\\nThe focus on large data sets is not an just an engineering challenge; it is an essential feature of induction\\nof expressive representations from raw data. It is only by analyzing large data sets that we can produce\\naccurate logical descriptions that can be translated automatically into powerful predictive mechanisms.\\nOtherwise, statistical and machine learning principles suggest the need for substantial user input\\n(specifying meta-knowledge necessary to acquire highly predictive models from small data sets). \\n3. Recent Research AchievementsThe opportunities today in data mining rest solidly on a variety of research achievements, the majority\\nof which were the result of government sponsored research. In this section, we mention a few of the\\nmore important ones. Note that several of them are interdisciplinary in nature, resting on discoveries\\nmade by researchers from different disciplines working together collaboratively. Neural Networks.  Neural networks are systems inspired by the human brain. A basic example is\\nprovided by a back propagation network which consists of input nodes, output nodes, and intermediate\\nnodes called hidden nodes. Initially, the nodes are connected with random weights. During the training,\\na gradient descent algorithm is used to adjust the weights so that the output nodes correctly classify data\\npresented to the input nodes. The algorithm was invented independently by several groups of\\nresearchers.\\nTree-based Classifiers.  A tree is a convenient way to break a large data sets into smaller ones. By\\npresenting a learning set to the root and asking questions at each interior node, the data at the leaves can\\noften be analyzed very simply. For example, a classifier to predict the likelihood that a credit card\\ntransaction is fraudulent may use an interior node to divide a training data set into two sets, depending\\nupon whether or not five or fewer transactions were processed during the previous hour. After a series of\\nsuch questions, each leaf can be labeled fraud/no-fraud by using a simple majority vote. Tree based\\nclassifiers were independently invented in information theory, statistics, pattern recognition and machine\\nlearning. \\nGraphical Models and Hierarchical Probabilistic Representations.  A directed graph is a good means of\\norganizing information about qualitative knowledge about conditional independence and causality\\ngleamed from domain experts. Graphical models generalize generalize Markov models and hidden\\nMarkov models, which have proved themselves to be a powerful modeling tool. Graphical models were\\nindependently invented by computational probabilists and artificial intelligence researchers studying\\nuncertainty. Ensemble Learning.  Rather than use data mining to build a single predictive model, it is often better to\\nbuild a collection or ensemble of models and to combine them, say with a simple, efficient voting\\nstrategy. This simple idea has now been applied in a wide variety of contexts and applications. In some\\ncircumstances, this technique is known to reduce variance of the predictions and therefore to decrease\\nthe overall error of the model. Linear Algebra.  Scaling data mining algorithms often depends critically upon scaling underlying\\ncomputations in linear algebra. Recent work in parallel algorithms for solving linear system and\\nalgorithms for solving sparse linear systems in high dimensions are important for a variety of data\\nmining applications, ranging from text mining to detecting network intrusions.Large Scale Optimization.  Some data mining algorithms can be expressed as large-scale, often\\nnon-convex, optimization problems. Recent work has provided parallel and distributed methods for\\nlarge-scale continuous and discrete optimization problems, including heuristic search methods for\\nproblems too large to be solved exactly.High Performance Computing and Communication.  Data mining requires statistically intensive\\noperations on large data sets. These types of computations would not be practical without the emergence\\nof powerful SMP workstations and high performance clusters of workstations supporting protocols for\\nhigh performance computing such as MPI and MPIO. Distributed data mining can require moving largeamounts of data between geographically separated sites, something which is now possible with the\\nemergence of wide area high performance networks.Databases, Data Warehouses, and Digital Libraries.  The most time consuming part of the data mining\\nprocess is preparing data for data mining. This step can be stream-lined in part if the data is already in a\\ndatabase, data warehouse, or digital library, although mining data across different databases, for\\nexample, is still a challenge. Some algorithms, such as association algorithms, are closely connected to\\ndatabases, while some of the primitive operations being built into tomorrow’s data warehouses should\\nprove useful for some data mining applications.\\nVisualization of Massive Data Sets.  Massive data sets, often generated by complex simulation programs,\\nrequired graphical visualization methods for best comprehension. Recent advances in multi-scale\\nvisualization allow the rendering to be done far more quickly and in parallel, making these visualization\\ntasks practical.\\n4. New Applications\\nThe discipline of data mining is driven in part by new applications which require new capabilities not\\ncurrently being supplied by today’s technology. These new applications can be naturally divided into\\nthree broad categories.\\na.Business & E-commerce Data.  Back-office, front-office, and network applications produce large\\namounts of data about business processes. Using this data for effective decision making remains a\\nfundamental challenge. \\nb.Scientific, Engineering & Health Care Data.  Scientific data and meta-data tend to be more\\ncomplex in structure than business data. In addition, scientists and engineers are making increasing\\nuse of simulation and of systems with application domain knowledge.\\nc.Web Data.  The data on the web is growing not only in volume but also in complexity. Web data\\nnow includes not only text and image, but also streaming data and numerical data. \\nIn this section, we describe several such applications from each category.Business Transactions.  Today, businesses are consolidating and more and more businesses have millions\\nof customers and billions of their transactions. They need to understand risks (Is this transaction\\nfraudulent? Will this customer pay their bills?) and opportunities (What is the expected profit of this\\ncustomer? What product is this customer most likely to buy next?).Electronic Commerce.  Not only does electronic commerce produce large data sets in which the analysis\\nof marketing patterns and risk patterns is critical, but unlike some of the applications above, it is also\\nimportant to do this in real or near-real time, in order to meet the demands of on-line transactions.\\nGenomic Data.  Genomic sequencing and mapping efforts have produced a number of databases which\\nare accessible over the web. In addition, there are also a wide variety of other on-line databases,\\nincluding those containing information about diseases, cellular function, and drugs. Finding\\nrelationships between these data sources, which are largely unexplored, is another fundamental data\\nmining challenge. Recently, scalable techniques have been developed for comparing whole genomes.Sensor Data.  Satellites, buoys, balloons, and a variety of other sensors produce voluminous amounts of\\ndata about the earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and lands. A fundamental challenge is to understand the\\nrelationships, including causal relationships amongst this data. For example, do industrial pollutants\\naffect global warming? There are also large terabyte to petabyte data sets being produced by sensors and\\ninstruments in other disciplines, such as astronomy, high energy physics, and nuclear physics. \\nSimulation Data.  Simulation is now accepted as a third mode of science, supplementing theory and\\nexperiment. Today, not only do experiments produce huge data sets, but so do simulations. Data mining,\\nand more generally data intensive computing, is proving to be a critical link between theory, simulation,\\nand experiment. Health Care Data.  Health care has been the most rapidly growing segment of the nation’s GDP for some\\ntime. Hospitals, health care organizations, insurance companies, and the federal government have large\\ncollections of data about patients, their health care problems, the clinical procedures used, their costs,\\nand the outcomes. Understanding relationships in this data is critical for a wide variety of problems,\\nranging from determining what procedures and clinical protocols are most effective to how best to\\ndeliver health care to the most people in an era of diminishing resources.\\nMulti-media Documents.  Few people are satisfied with today’s technology for retrieving documents on\\nthe web, yet the number of documents and the number of people accessing these documents is growing\\nexplosively. In addition, it is becoming easier and and easier to archive multi-media data, including\\naudio, images, and video data, but harder and harder to extract meaningful information from the archives\\nas the volume grows. \\nThe Data Web.  Today the web is primarily oriented toward documents and their multi-media extensions.\\nHTML has proved itself to be a simple, yet powerful language for supporting this. Tomorrow the\\npotential exists for the web to prove equally important for working with data. The Extensible Markup\\nLanguage (XML) is an emerging language for working with data in networked environments. As this\\ninfrastructure grows, data mining is expected to be a critical enabling technology for the emerging data\\nweb.\\n5. Success Stories\\nIn this section, we briefly describe some success stories involving data mining and knowledge\\ndiscovery.\\nAssociation Rules.  Suppose we have a collection of items. The data for many applications consists of\\nmultiple transactions, where each transaction consists of one or more items. A basic example is provided\\nby a supermarket, where the items are the products offered for sale and the transactions are purchases,\\nconsisting of one or more products purchased by an individual at a given time. A fundamental problem\\nis to uncover associations: which products tend to be purchased together. There has been a lot of recent\\nwork on this problem and a variety of algorithms have been developed which can be discover\\nassociations, even in very large data sets, with just a few passes over the data. A variety of commercial\\ndata mining systems support association rules and they are now routinely applied to a range of problems\\nfrom database marketing to product placement for supermarkets. In addition, association rules\\nalgorithms have spurred new research in a variety of areas from databases to complexity theory. \\nFraud Detection.  Although relatively few credit card transactions are fraudulent, the sheer volume oftransactions means that over $500M are lost each year in this way. A variety of data mining techniques\\nhave been used to develop fraud systems which can detect fraudulent credit card transactions in\\nnear-real time. This problem is challenging due to the size of the data sets, the rarity of the events of\\ninterest, and the performance requirements for near-real time detection. Data mining has also improved\\nfraud detection in other application areas, including telcom fraud and insurance fraud. \\nAstronomical Data.  Traditionally, the search for new galaxies, stars, and quasars has primarily been\\ndone by astronomers visually examining individual photographic plates. Classification algorithms from\\ndata mining have recently been used to automate this process yielding new astronomical discoveries.\\nThe classification algorithms are applied to derived attributes produced by image processing, such as the\\nbrightness, area, and morphology of sky objects. The approach has also proved useful for detecting new\\nobjects too faint to be observed by a manual analysis or traditional computational techniques. For the\\n2nd Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, this approach resulted in over a three-fold increase in the size of\\nthe catalog.\\nGenomic Data.  Genomic data is stored all over the world, in a variety of formats and managed by a\\nvariety of applications and systems. Recently, systems have been developed which allow discoveries to\\nbe made involving information distributed over several systems. In particular, the new systems have\\nenabled for the first time whole genome comparison, gene identification, and whole genome functional\\ninterpretation and analysis. The techniques developed for analyzing genomic and other types of\\nscientific data can be expected to to play a role on analyzing a broad range of biological data.Distributed Data Mining. Traditionally, data mining has required that the relevant data be warehoused in\\na single location. Recently, distributed data mining systems have exploited wide area, high performance\\nnext networks, such as the NSF vBNS network, to mine large amounts of distributed scientific and\\nhealth care data. Recently, these systems have set records for the sustained movement of very large\\namounts of data over wide area networks. Separately, a prototype has been developed exploiting\\ndistributed data mining to improve the detection of credit card fraud.\\nText Mining.  Recently, data mining has been combined with algorithms from information retrieval to\\nimprove the precision and recall of queries on very large collections of documents. In particular, some\\nof these algorithms have proved useful on multi-lingual collections and others have shown their worth\\non querying using concepts instead of key words.\\n6. Trends that Effect Data Mining\\nIn this section, we describe five external trends which promise to have a fundamental impact on data\\nmining.Data Trends.  Perhaps the most fundamental external trend is the explosion of digital data during the past\\ntwo decades. During this period, the amount of data probably has grown between six to ten orders of\\nmagnitude. Much of this data is accessible via networks. On the other hand, during this same period the\\nnumber of scientists, engineers, and other analysts available to analyze this data has remained relatively\\nconstant. For example, the number of new Ph.D.’s in statistics graduating each year has remained\\nrelatively constant during this period. Only one conclusion is possible: either most of the data is destined\\nto be write-only, or techniques, such as data mining, must be developed, which can automate, in part, the\\nanalysis of this data, filter irrelevant information, and extract meaningful knowledge.Hardware Trends.  Data mining requires numerically and statistically intensive computations on large\\ndata sets. The increasing memory and processing speed of workstations enables the mining of data sets\\nusing current algorithms and techniques that were too large to be mined just a few years ago. In addition,\\nthe commoditization of high performance computing through SMP workstations and high performance\\nworkstation clusters enables attacking data mining problems that were accessible using only the largest\\nsupercomputers of a few years ago.Network Trends.  The next generation internet (NGI) will connect sites at OC-3 (155 MBits/sec) speeds\\nand higher. This is over 100 times faster than the connectivity provided by current networks. With this\\ntype of connectivity, it becomes possible to correlate distributed data sets using current algorithms and\\ntechniques. In addition, new protocols, algorithms, and languages are being developed to facilitate\\ndistributed data mining using current and next generation networks.\\nScientific Computing Trends.  As mentioned above, scientists and engineers today view simulation as a\\nthird mode of science. Data mining and knowledge discovery serves an important role linking the three\\nmodes of science: theory, experiment and simulation, especially for those cases in which the experiment\\nor simulation results in large data sets.Business Trends.  Today businesses must be more profitable, react quicker, and offer higher quality\\nservices than ever before, and do it all using fewer people and at lower cost. With these types of\\nexpectations and constraints, data mining becomes a fundamental technology, enabling businesses to\\nmore accurately predict opportunities and risks generated by their customers and their customers’\\ntransactions.\\n7. Research Challenges\\nIn this section, we describe some of the major research challenges identified by the three workshops.\\nThe research challenges are arranged into five broad areas: A) improving the scalability of data mining\\nalgorithms, B) mining non-vector data, C) mining distributed data, D) improving the ease of use of data\\nmining systems and environments, and E) privacy and security issues for data mining.\\nA. Scaling data mining algorithms.  Most data mining algorithms today assume that the data fits into\\nmemory. Although success on large data sets is often claimed, usually this is the result of sampling large\\ndata sets until they fit into memory. A fundamental challenge is to scale data mining algorithms as \\n1.the number of records or observations increases; \\n2.the number of attributes per observation increases; \\n3.the number of predictive models or rule sets used to analyze a collection of observations increases;\\n4.and, as the demand for interactivity and real-time response increases. \\nNot only must distributed, parallel, and out-of-memory versions of current data mining algorithms be\\ndeveloped, but genuinely new algorithms are required. For example, association algorithms today can\\nanalyze out-of-memory data with one or two passes, while requiring only some auxiliary data be kept in\\nmemory. B. Extending data mining algorithms to new data types.  Today, most data mining algorithms work with\\nwith vector-valued data. It is an important challenge to extend data mining algorithms to work with\\nother data types, including 1) time series and process data, 2) unstructured data, such as text, 3)semi-structured data, such as HTML and XML documents, 4) multi-media and collaborative data, 5)\\nhierarchical and multi-scale data, and 6) and collection-valued data. \\nC. Developing distributed data mining algorithms.  Today most data mining algorithms require bringing\\nall together data to be mined in a single, centralized data warehouse. A fundamental challenge is to\\ndevelop distributed versions of data mining algorithms so that data mining can be done while leaving\\nsome of the data in place. In addition, appropriate protocols, languages, and network services are\\nrequired for mining distributed data to handle the meta-data and mappings required for mining\\ndistributed data. As wireless and pervasive computing environments become more common, algorithms\\nand systems for mining the data produced by these types of systems must also be developed.D. Ease of Use.  Data mining today is at best a semi-automated process and perhaps destined to always\\nremain so. On the other hand, a fundamental challenge is to develop data mining systems which are\\neasier to use, even by casual users. Relevant techniques include improving user interface, supporting\\ncasual browsing and visualization of massive and distributed data sets, developing techniques and\\nsystems to manage the meta-data required for data mining, and developing appropriate languages and\\nprotocols for providing casual access to data. In addition, the development of data mining and\\nknowledge discovery environments  which address the process  of collecting, processing, mining, and\\nvisualizing data, as well as the collaborative and reporting aspects necessary when working with data\\nand information derived from it, is another important fundamental challenge.E. Privacy and Security.  Data mining can be a powerful means of extracting useful information from\\ndata. As more and more digital data becomes available, the potential for misuse of data mining grows. A\\nfundamental challenge is to develop privacy and security models and protocols appropriate for data\\nmining and to ensure that next generation data mining systems are designed from the ground up to\\nemploy these models and protocols.\\n8. Testbeds and Infrastructure\\nExperimental studies will play a critical role in advancing the field of data mining. Developed testbeds\\nfor high performance and distributed data mining is essential for progress in the field. \\nThe requirements for data mining testbeds are different than those for general purpose high performance\\ncomputing testbeds. For example, the computing resources for data mining testbeds are as much\\ndisk-oriented as processor-oriented; the network resources must be able move data sets and data\\nelements between geographically distributed sites with guaranteed quality of service; and a variety of\\ngeneral purpose and specialized data mining software must be available.\\nPerhaps the two most difficult challenges in creating data mining testbeds and national resources in data\\nmining are assembling a) the appropriate data sets and b) the required interdisciplinary and\\nmultidisciplinary teams. \\n9. Findings and Recommendations\\nIn this section, we list some of the major findings of these three workshops.\\nFor all interested parties:Data mining and knowledge discovery is a new emerging discipline with both a scientific and\\nengineering component that is of strategic importance for the U.S. and of critical importance to future\\ninformation access technologies. All interested parties are encouraged to work towards the maturation of\\ndata mining and knowledge discovery, towards its establishment as a scientific and engineering\\ndiscipline in its own right, and towards the evolution of a community that includes the relevant traditions\\nand disciplines and puts them together in the proper context.\\nFor the federal government:  \\n1.Create programs which encourage the emergence of data mining and knowledge discovery as an\\nindependent discipline.\\n2.Support interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research projects. Many advances in data mining\\nrequire teams of mathematicians and statisticians, computer scientists, and application domain\\nscientists working together to create the appropriate data sets and the required algorithms and\\nsoftware to analyze them. \\n3.Support basic research in computer and information sciences that underlies data mining, including\\nmachine learning, knowledge systems, data bases, high performance computing, high performance\\nnetworking, and digital libraries. \\n4.Support basic research in mathematics and statistics that underlies data mining, including statistics,\\nprobability, applied mathematics, logic, discrete mathematics, analysis and dynamical systems,\\nlinear algebra, and computational geometry and algebra.\\n5.Support data mining testbeds. The hardware, software, data and consulting requirements for data\\nmining often out-strip the resources of individual scientists and small research groups. Supporting\\nnational resources and testbeds for data mining is important in order to provide the proper\\nexperimental infrastructure required for next generation data mining experiments.\\nFor companies:\\n1.Support applied research in data mining.\\n2.Work to develop, implement and support appropriate privacy and security models for data mining\\nsystems.\\n3.Create sanitized versions of real data sets for use by data mining researchers.\\n4.Support joint research projects between industry and universities. Support collaborative testbeds\\nand demonstration projects. \\nFor scientists and engineers:\\n1.As new data is collected and archived, support emerging protocols, languages, and standards to\\nfacilitate the future analysis and mining of the data, especially by scientists and engineers from\\nother disciplines.2.As new data is collected and as new systems are built to manage it, ensure that the best available\\nprivacy and security models are used to protect inadvertent disclosures of private information.\\n3.Provide long-term maintenance and access to data sets created by scientists and engineers, as well\\nas to the knowledge and information extracted from them.\\n10. Conclusions\\nData mining and knowledge discovery are emerging as a new discipline with important applications to\\nscience, engineering, health care, education, and business. Data mining rests firmly on 1) research\\nadvances obtained during the past two decades in a variety of areas and 2) more recent technological\\nadvances in computing, networking and sensors. Data mining is driven by the explosion of digital data\\nand the scarcity of scientists, engineers, and domain experts available to analyze it.\\nData mining is beginning to contribute research advances of its own, by providing scalable extensions\\nand advances to work in associations, ensemble learning, graphical models, techniques for on-line\\ndiscovery, and algorithms for the exploration of massive and distributed data sets.\\nAdvances in data mining requires a) supporting single investigators working in data mining and the\\nunderlying research domains supporting data mining; b) supporting inter-disciplinary and\\nmulti-disciplinary research groups working on important basic and applied data mining problems; and c)\\nsupporting the appropriate testbeds for mining large, massive and distributed data sets.\\nAppropriate privacy and security models for data mining must be developed and implemented.\\n11.
